the sacred taking(siren wailing in distance)(glass bottle rolling)(glass shatters in distance)(cat yowls)(squeaking)MAN: Let me guess.You work the late shift, some shit-hole diner.Now you're taking the shortcut home.You don't go home till I say.(unzips zipper)Make me fight for it, I'll carve you up in big thick slices, then plug every hole you got.What you did?What I do.This works, too.(screams)ZOE (echoing): Queenie.Queenie.What the hell are you doing?Nothing you'd understand.This is voodoo.You're a witch.We need you back in the coven.Marie Laveau set me straight.You were never my friends.Oh, boo-friggin'-hoo.You switched because girls were mean to you?Fiona slit my throat. You don't see me bitching out.ZOE: We know our coven's a sh1t show right now.But things are changing. A new Supreme is rising.And who's that? You?Fiona filled my head with that bullshit, too.That bitch will say anything if it gets her what she wants.This isn't for you. Yet.(grunts)Holy sh1t.You just killed an innocent man!Innocent? Shows what you know.This b*st*rd raped three schoolgirls that we know of, probably more.Marie Laveau needs a dark heart, and I'm gonna give it to her.(grunts)(exhales)Voodoo Queen is making a special potion to give me more powers.Fiona ever do that?Huh?Voodoo, witchcraft.This town ain't big enough for the two of us.War is coming.And you're gonna lose.(heart continues beating)FIONA: Meningeal carcinomatosis.That's what the doctor called it.Tiny seedlings that the cancer plantedin the lining of my spine.The little bastardsare Satan's diet pill.(retching)I used to thinkI understood pain.A burn, a cut, a broken bone.(groaning)Heartbreak.But this is as if I've beendipped in the River Styxand all the sufferingof all the souls that ever wereor will be has soaked my body.My body doesn't belong to me--not that I'd want itin this state.I'm startingto look less Samanthaand more Endora every day.And what could be more painfulthan having to tell your childthat you're going to die?The doctors say it's terminal.Do me a favor.Die before Thanksgiving, so none of us have to suffer through that mess of raisins and Styrofoam you call stuffing.FIONA: They say loveis the best medicine.You are so beautiful.You're just a fool in love.You like the way I look, take a picture.A month from now, I'll be a... a balding and toothless skeleton.So run away with me.Paris.Rome. Marrakesh.(chuckles)We can spend that month together.(chuckles)(groans)I don't want you watching me decay.Are you scared?I'm not scared of dying.I'm scared of living like this.The constant pain and the ugliness.You ever consider making it stop?No.I wouldn't give anyone the satisfaction of me killing myself.Mm.I'll stay alivejust to spite them.You know, the only reason......my cancer is moving so fast and my hair's falling out like dead weight...(sighs)...is because one of those girls is coming into her own.Flexing her muscle.I just have to figure outwhich one of thoselittle pecker-heads it is.JOAN: Bitch.(hisses)Her name is Nan.Dark-sided. The whole lot of them.They worship the devil.That's not true, Mother.Where else could they get their dark power from?Look what they did to you.You don't get it! They saved me!Only Jesus can save you.But only if you repent.Only if you cleanse yourself of all the impurities."Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts."Nothing happened in that house.You brought this on yourself. You had no business goingto that house.You don't haveto do this, Mother.Oh, but I do.You're unclean.From the inside out.But we're going to fix that.Take off your pants.♪LUKE (crying):Don't! No, no! No! No!She's hurting him.Sit down, Nan.Let go of everything outside this room right now.Losing Queenie is a terrible failure.My failure.But as of now, she's dead to me.And no one else will slip through the cracks.Let's get back to the battle plan.(doorbell rings)It begins with killing Fiona.We can't afford to wait.MADISON: I should be the one.I want to slit her throat.No.You have to stay hidden until it's time.She cannot know you're back.We have one shot.That's it.Our plan has to be flawless.So does the execution.Failure turns this intoa suicide mission.(doorbell rings)Where the hell is Spalding?Delphine?I'll get it.(rapid knocking)Misty?You have to save me.I knew the world could be a dark and evil place.It drove me to my haven in the swamp.I had my Stevie. My garden.(whispers): I tried to disappear into nature.But I have been found.(cicadas chirping)Aw.Aw, you probably have no idea where you are.Hmm.You've been through a terrifying ordeal, but you came back.You're safe now.Not likely, my dear.There's a man in the woods with a gun circling the shack.I saw the assassin when he nearly stepped on my face.Do you hear that?No.The cicadas have stopped singing.(heart beating)(floorboard creaks)(panting)We hid in the swamp through the night.Made our way here when I was sure he was gone.Who's there?ZOE: A witch.Seeking safety.Somebody is looking to kill me.(gasps)(screaming, indistinct voices)You're Misty Day.You were set on fire and left for dead.Whatever troubles you had, they are ours now.You're under the protection of this coven.This is your house.Could my friend stay, also?I left her out back in the greenhouse.(insects chirring)Hello?Don't worry. You're amongst friends.Of course I am, Cordelia.So long as Fiona isn't with you.Myrtle? Oh, my God.I thought I'd never see you again.Poor choice of words, girl.But given my wretched appearance, maybe it's a good thing you're blind as a butter knife.How did your hair grow back so quick?Oh, little bird, I've been buying in bulk from North Korea for years.What have they done to you?I've lost my eyes.You were burned at the stake, and our own Supreme murdered one of her witches.I'm afraid this coven has fallen on hard times.Or maybe it's the best of times.Resurrection is a feat more difficult than all the tests of the Seven Wonders.Those of us who have recently died have been brought back to life by the hand of one person here.Misty Day.Behold, our next Supreme.MALE VOICE: Our journey starts today.Sort some sounds and read the books, and we'll be on our way.(bird chirping, whooshing)I can't.(video turns off) Not now.We're doing a thing downstairs, so you have to stay here, okay?And get real smart.So you can finally tell me what's going on in your head.Relax.We're sharing him, remember?(sighs) What's this?We're gonna be busy all night.Now he has something to do.Why can't he watch p0rn and jerk off like any other guy?And why can't he learn something so he can rejoin society and have a life?(scoffs)(sighs)Be good, baby.We'll have fun later.(female voice playing over video)(video game sound effects playing)(gasps)MALE VOICE: See if you can guess...(male voice continues through headphones)Mothballs and history.It's a cocktail I swoon for.I feel like a queen.MADISON: How does putting on this smelly old stuff help us get rid of Fiona?It's part of a ceremony called the "Sacred Taking," which allows for the ascension of the new Supreme.And we're sure Misty's the next Supreme?I'm certain of her credentials.She's brought backmore people from the dead than Jesus Christ.Disappointed?You thought it was you, didn't you?Well, I knew it wasn't you, because when Fiona cut your throat, you died.It could be any one of us.Not really. It's pretty obvious.And what does that mean?Being the Supreme isn't something to wish for.It's not a gift. It's a burden.How many of these women had happy lives?They had the power,but with it came the crushing responsibility of the coven.They all bowed under the weight, except my mother, who ran from it.Can I say something?I don't want to be the Supreme.CORDELIA: Nobody gets to choose.When Fiona dies, whoever it is... will be.Now, give me your hands.We're ready to begin.The Sacred Taking is a ritualused in times of crisisto ensure the survivalof the coven.It has been invoked three timesin our history.The first, duringthe Salem Witch Trials in .The coven had decidedto flee south,away from Salemand the persecutionof the Court of Oyerand Terminer.The reigning Supremeat that time, Prudence Mather,suffered from consumption,and knew she would be too weakto make the journey.(creaking)She gathered her witchesand invoked the Sacred Taking.It's the most hallowedsacrifice a Supreme can make.Prudence took her own life,which allowed a new Supremeto riseand lead them to safety.MYRTLE:Can you imaginethose poor Salem witches,traveling all the way down here in covered wagons without a proper charcuterieplatter or a bidet?Absolutely savage!Does nobody see the flaw in this plan?You really expect that narcissistic bitch to kill herself for this coven?Not without a push.(coughing, retching)(sighs)(groaning)(sighs)(instrumental rock music playing)(music continues loudly)♪ When I look out my window♪ Many sights to see♪ And when I look in my window... ♪(Madison sighs)I just love this room, especially the walk-in closet.I need that.And my Warhol Mao would look great on this wall. (laughs)Madison?Surprise, bitch.I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.Hmm. How soon can you have all of your stuff out of here?I really need my own room.Oh, and a bed.I can't wait to break it in.God knows it's not getting any action from you, Grandma. (laughs)What are you?♪ Must be the season of the witch, yeah... ♪Who brought you back?Are you deaf?I'm the next Supreme.I brought myself back.(chuckles)Looks like you've got some 'splainin' to do.Maybe we should call the Council.Oh, wait. You killed Myrtle, too.Well, that won't matter.We all know the playbook on this.You killed me, so we burn you at the stake.I'm gonna bring marshmallows and graham crackers to make s'mores.(laughs)Does Cordelia know?That you killed me?Everyone knows.You'll be hash browns by this time tomorrow.Of course, you're half-dead already.♪ Sure is strange...Get out!(door creaks open)(sighs)Poor Fifi.As my powers grow... yours fade away.Let me break this down for you-- and stop me if I talk too fast.I'm in, you're out.And you can leave this world one of two ways.You can burn at the stake tomorrow, which would be messy and painful, although very entertaining.Or......you can swallow these pills and go to sleep.Stop suffering.And stop our suffering.The choice is yours.(laughs)(pills clatter on floor)♪ You got to pick up every stitch ♪
♪ Two rabbits running in the ditch... ♪MYRTLE: Going somewhere?Oh.Is everyone back from the dead, or have I already died and gone to heaven?Well, I suppose it would be hell, you know.I've been resurrected by our new Supreme, young Madison.She rather reminds me of you in your youth, thin as a pin with a dreadful case of the "me, me, mes."(laughs) Yes.Well, I wish her the best.I will be... on the island... of Patmos.That's not one of the choices, darling.Take your own life or be burned, I believe it was.No, I'm not ready.I have finally found someone I belong to.Someone I truly love.No details, darling.I couldn't bear it.I am very ill, Myrtle.I won't last long.And he wants to take care of me.You haven't thought through this, Fiona.Maybe it's your weakened state.(footsteps echoing)You're still my beautiful angel.MYRTLE: This dream of a perfect love you're clinging to is just a nasty trick life is playing on you.You will die the same way you lived your life-- alone and disappointed by everyone.What's the matter?Huh?MYRTLE:He won't stay till the end.They promise, but... they don't.FIONA:You are nothing... but an envious old bitch.(groans softly)Where are you going?This is taking too long for you to die.FIONA (whispers):Don't... don't leave.The smells-- they make me sick.Your breath, your piss, your shit-- this whole room smells of death!I know. I'll die soon.I promise.(grunts)How'd it go?Boffo.She thinks I'm the next Supreme.Why can't it be me?Because you have no style and your pits smell like fish sticks.Do you think I could be the Supreme?You guys suck balls.Nan...(crickets chirping)(wind whooshing)(door creaks)NAN: Luke?Luke?(muffled grunting in distance)(muffled grunting continues)Luke?(grunts)Oh, God.You're preparing the corpse.(sighs)Be a dear, will you?Come hold this mirror for me.My hand shakes so from those meds.Life is a carnival, Myrtle.(laughs)Oh, my God.Do you remember Levon?The drummer with The Band.Great God, he was something.I was so crazy about him.(chuckles)We had such a... wild six months together in Woodstock.Anyway, the point is......some play it safe on the merry-go-round, others go for the thrills on the roller coaster.I mean, I could sit here and boo-hoo my choices, torment myself...over the selfish detours I have taken.But what good would it do now? Hmm?Do me a favor, get me my fur from the closet.(sighs)They were all over me that season.(chuckles)But Levon, mm...(smacks lips)Oh, my.It was preemptive, I suppose, my leaving.Get out of town before they run you out on a rail.I've always been rigorous about not staying too long at the party.Bad form.Know when it's over.(sighs)Look after my beautiful Delia, will you?My most... terrible failure.One that'll torment me into eternity, I imagine.And you've chosen the perfect color for your lips.I could never pull off the corals.Make sure they hang my portraitin the place I chose.Don't let them store me in the basement with that disgraced... Russian witch.(exhales)♪Half of it's paste, but goddamn half of it's good.(door closes)SPALDING: Madame.Wake up.Spalding?You need to take this. We must purge you of this poison.(whispers):You can speak.Yes.I was murdered.Those idiot girls thought they could silence me, but they've only given me voice here in the spirit world.years, my family has been a clan of watchers.And now... I see everything.Take this.No, Spalding... you don't understand.(panting weakly):I am finally... trying to do... something decent... something noble for the coven.(chuckles softly)Horseshit.(spoon clatters)You're making a martyr of yourself by giving up.You've been tricked.You've allowed a pack of lesser witches to buffalo you into this ignominious end.I won't permit it.I don't understand.They've been running a number on you.Huh?Madison Montgomery is not the next Supreme.She didn't conquer death.She was brought back by some dirty little... swamp witch.They've been leading you to your doom with lies.Lies... you swallowed more easily than those pills.Huh?(retching)(panting)(toilet flushes)(spits)(chuckles softly)Oh, Spalding... you've always been my silent sentinel.(panting)And I will avenge your murder.Right after I've avenged my own.♪Delphine?(sniffles)Is that a Jumpin' Jack with cheese I smell?(laughs)Mmm.Oh!Heaven.Ain't they feeding you?All they ever do is bleed me for her poultice.Come tomorrow, I'm gonna be dry as a bone.Whatever did I do to deserve this betrayal?Didn't you like my pot pie and my peach crumble I learned how to make just for you?You put me in here.You can get me out.Only for a minute, just so I can stretch my legs.This cage is just un-unfit for a human.Which is why it's so perfect for you.What I told you about feeding the animals?Queenie?I'm sorry, reine.Mm.(sighs)You know, when I had the idea to have you brought back to me, I thought of all the many ways I could dispose of you.But I've found it give me great pleasure just to know you in a cage.Shut your mouth, Negress.Bring me something to drink in a clean glass, so I can enjoy my food in silence.I'm not your damn maid!And if I were you, I wouldn't be so eager to show my arrogance from that side of the cage.What you gonna do? Kill me?(laughs)I can't die.(laughs)Eh, throw me back in the box.I seen enough of this world.I'll take no part in a country that has a darkie in the White House.Hundred years from now, when they dig me up again, the natural order will be restored.You think I only have those two choices?The mistake you make is from a lack of imagination.I'm not afraid of you.I wouldn't give you that satisfaction.(screaming)Dear God!

I have to get you out of here.No!This... road...goes...two... ways.What does it mean, Kyle?I...love......you.I love you, too.Where are all the servants?I might have slept until noon.You didn't really make this coffee all on your own, did you?I'm not entirely helpless, Mother.Oh, no, of course not.Though I do think we might move your bed downstairs.I mean, we wouldn't want you to have a... accident coming down those steps.Wouldn't we?I'd much rather be found at the bottom of those stairs than be burned at the stake.According to Auntie Myrtle,that just hurts like hell.Oh, Cordelia.You don't really think I'd do something like that to my own daughter?Cut the sh1t, Fiona.We both know I tried to orchestrate your death last night.Yes.And very nearly succeeded.If you're waiting for me to get down on my knees and beg for your forgiveness, you can forget it.It's not gonna happen.Beg?I might throw you a parade.What you and your girls demonstrated last night was real grit.I finally have hope for the future of this coven.And you, my dear......I'm so proud of.You really are my daughter.Now you're proud?Hell... if I knew how easy it was to win your approval, I would have made an attempt on your life way before now.(laughs, sniffles)What's this?CORDELIA: A silver bullet.I found it last night in the street.It's blessed.Mm-hmm.Witch hunters.(doorbell rings)I'll admit, when I found it, I was glad you were still with us.We need you now, Fiona.More than ever.(doorbell rings)Where are the servants?♪Who was it?I don't know.(wheezes)Help.The End
