I. s.Jingles was a vet.He probably dug this up- like the ones he saw in 'Nam.- Are you sure it was Jingles and not the other guy trying to kill us?Jesus Christ.What the hell kind of camp is this?BROOKE: Where is everyone?They should be here by now.I'm sure they're coming.The boys' cabin is just further away.No.It's been too long.Hey, maybe we should just go and get help.And leave everyone here to fend for themselves?Your friends wouldn't bail on you like that.I'm not bailing.The highway's not far.Maybe we could get the police to come down here.You're right.Go.I'll wait.I'll tell the others you went for help.Thank you.I'll be back as soon(MUFFLED SCREAMING)Oh, honey.I wish you could see your face right now.You're confused, aren't you?Don't worry.Nurse Rita's gonna make it all better.Well, Ms.Chambers, you've certainly put in the work.Dartmouth, Penn.I have to say you look remarkably well-rested for someone in the throes of doctoral research.But I'm sorry to tell you that you've wasted your time coming here.Benjamin Richter is a lost cause.I doubt that.He hasn't said a word in years.I've tried every angle to get him to talk, but he just stares back at you with those black shark eyes.Now, I know, in our profession, we like to think there's always method behind madness a linear path from innocence, wounding, to violence and sociopathy.But all I've been shown by Benjamin Richter is that some people are just evil.My research has shown otherwise.I recently spoke to Ted Bundy down in Florida and pried confessions to two unsolved murders from him.I wasn't aware of that.The feds wanted to keep it on the down-low.But I've talked to them all.Gacy, William Bonin, aka the Freeway Killer, Patrick Kearney, aka the Trash Bag Killer, Robert Hansen, aka the Butcher Baker all their lips are sealed.Until Donna Chambers arrives and opens them.This case has been your life for over a decade.Do you really want to go to your grave not knowing what makes that man tick?Worst case, he clams up for me, too.And I leave like a fool.Be smart.Now, if you're gonna be alone with him, he stays restrained.This guy can regress to violent behavior at any time.The reawakening of Mr. Jingles.I just mean to get a window into that side of him would be valuable.Academically.And I appreciate the restraints.Safety first.Mr. Richter.This is Donna Chambers.She's doing research for a PhD.She'd like to talk to you.You're not gonna get anything out of this guy.We'll be fine.Won't we, Benjamin?And I'm going to need a record of everything you discussed.- Regulations.- Of course.I'll be right outside if you need me.(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)I spoke to Dr.Hopple.She thinks that you're evil.That you were born to kill.Do you believe that?'Cause I don't.I don't believe in evil.I believe that while the ability to do violence exists in all people, the need to hurt to murder over and over needs to be activated by outside circumstances.You were drafted into the Army, trained to think nothing of human life.Sent to the jungle to kill in the name of patriotism.I know you don't like to talk, but answer me one question.Did you ever hurt anyone before that?Did you ever kill anything?I've been studying serial killers for the past five years.Since the mid-1970s there's been an uptick in spree or serial killings.Why?Were there suddenly more evil men born?Or did the increased availability of pornography and the psychic echo of the war in Southeast Asia damage the minds of otherwise good men?High fructose corn syrup.It's in everything now-a-days.They say it's bad for you.Maybe uh, that has something to do with it, too.So you can talk.I've been here, locked up, for 14 years.When I told them I couldn't remember killing those kids, they told me that I'd had a psychotic break, that I was evil and that I was the worst kind of human being.Irredeemable.What if I told you I don't think that's true.What if I told you that something twisted your brain and gave you no choice?So what you're saying is maybe it isn't all my fault?I'd like to help out.Can I help you?Well, you can't do it from in here.We got to get you out.I need to study you in your natural habitat.They're re-opening the camp.Even sitting here, looking at that face, I want to stab her over and over.I can't go back there.I know I would kill again.Sometimes sacrifices need to be made in the name of science.Feel my hands.(SHUDDERING BREATHS)So soft.That's my cold cream.How many bunnies had to die to get the formula right?If I could crack the code of what makes you do what you do, maybe we can begin mandatory classes in grade school.What if you could have the honor of being the world's last serial killer?Redemption.It's time to stop the violence.But why?Did someone hurt you?I have my reasons.But, most importantly I believe that no one is born evil, Benjamin.No one is irredeemable.I feel like I'm being seen for the first time in 14 years.Tell me what I have to do.All you have to do is be yourself.Don't hold back.Trust your instincts.But first we got to get you out of here.And in order to do that, you need to do three things: take care of that pesky guard, hit the switch(ALARM BUZZES)find the bag.When you meet me back at the camp I'll have a new job and a new name.- How could we end it all- This way When tomorrow comes And we'll both regret The things we said today If you leave me now- Ooh, no, baby.- (ENGINE STOPS)Can I help you?Excuse me, sweetie?You've been following me since I got on the 5.Oh.I'm sorry.I I was headed up to Camp Redwood.These were the directions I was given.Oh.(CHUCKLES)God.Oh, I am so sorry.It's just you hear all these horror stories on the news and they always start with a single woman driving alone and that woman ends up in a garbage bag by the side of the road.Goodness, you have a dark imagination.(BOTH CHUCKLE)I'm headed to Camp Redwood, too.I'm actually gonna be the nurse there.Hey, would you do me a favor?Can you keep an eye on my car while I head to the ladies'?Maybe we can convoy up - the rest of the way there.- Works for me.We girls got to look out for each other.(QUIETLY): Great.If you ask me, all those murders are because of the availability of pornography and the objectification of women in our culture.That's what that Ted Bundy said.What you think you're getting for free The woman is wild, a she-cat Tamed by the purr of a Jaguar Money's the matter If you're in it for love You ain't gonna get too far Oh, oh, here she comes Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up Oh, oh, here she comes She's a maneater Oh, oh, here she comes Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up.(BROOKE GRUNTS)My legs What did you give me?Horse tranquilizers.I think.I mean, I'm not a nurse.My degree's in psychology.Chet, are you with me?Chet.Chet.Look, you just passed out from the pain, man.You'll be okay.Goddamn it.I didn't even want to come here!(GRUNTS)I only left L. A.'cause I'm in trouble.You awake?Look I haven't told anyone about this, but I need to.I was in Omega Xi.And our hell week was always bad, but but my junior year, it really got out of hand.Got a thirst for killing Grab your vial, uh Brian, oh, there it is.Thank you.FRAT BOYS (CHANTING): Omega Xi, do or die!Omega Xi, do or die!Omega Xi, do or die!Omega Xi, do or die!Omega Xi, do or die!Omega Xi Take it down, anchor man.- Take it down!- (GAGGING)- Don't you puke on me.- Yeah!Next station, Gobs.Hell night never ends.(FRAT BOYS LAUGHING)Hush, hush, eye to eye, too shy, shy Left, right, left!Left, left, left, right, left.What the f*ck?(LAUGHS)Drink up, boys.And lose your uniforms.What do we do?Just grab a cock, Jew-bacca.Trunks to tails.I think I'm gonna hurl.Christ, Chan.You lightweight.Get up.Chan.Look, if you don't nut up, you're gonna get tossed at final blackball.Sir, I'm sorry, sir.I don't want to let down my pledge brothers.You're letting me down.Guys like us have to work twice as hard to be accepted here.That's f*cked up.Look, I'm giving you ten minutes.Okay?Take a nap, pull the trigger if you have to.Just get it together.Thank you, sir.(GRUNTING)(CRASH)sh1t.sh1t!Chan.Chan.Wake up.PLEDGE MASTER: Dude, what the hell happened?Um, he fell.I think he's dead.We're so f*cked.I'll take care of it.I mean, the way I saw it, I couldn't change the fact that Chan was dead, but I could keep us all out of trouble.And myself out of jail.I mean, his death was an accident, right?Does it really matter how that accident happened?Sorry, bro.Jesus!- What's happening?- Uh (GRUNTS)The brake!The brake!Oh, no.(GRUNTING)Grab on to me.Grab on to me!Grab on!Aah!I still remember his face.The look in his eyes as he went over the cliff.I couldn't go to the house.I couldn't go to classes.Eventually, I just dropped out.Which is how I ended up with this sh1t job at the hospital.People thought he, uh, went missing.I thought I'd gotten away with it.And then, three days ago, the Times reported that Chan's car had been found.Which means that it's it's only a matter of time before they find my watch.That's why I'm here.I'm running.It feels good to finally tell someone.I mean, I know you can't hear me.I can hear you.That's some messed-up sh1t.(COUGHS)I mean, it wasn't on purpose.I said I thought he was already dead.(LAUGHS)From the first time you killed him.I-I said he fell!Dude, what are you doing?I'm not dying down here with you.- Don't leave me down here.- (GRUNTS)Come on!Please.(CRYING): I won't tell anyone, I swear.Ray, please.(STRAINING)Ray!Ray, I swear, please, I won't tell anybody.Please don't leave me down here.Don't leave me down here!Ray!Looks quiet.Follow my lead.- (WHISPERS): Wait.- What?What about Margaret?We can't just let her die.Who gives a sh1t about Margaret?Our friends are waiting for us.I already got one person killed.If I can stop anyone else from dying, then maybe I can make this right.(SIGHS)Seriously?You saw what Jingles did to those asshole townies.Imagine what he's gonna do to the one person he couldn't kill.No, he's right.Nobody gets left behind.Look, we'll pick up Margaret on the way to the lot.Bertie, too.Who the hell is Bertie?- The cook.- You want us to risk our lives for Tammy Bakker and the lunch lady?Chef Bertie is good people.- (MUFFLED GRUNTING)- What the -
