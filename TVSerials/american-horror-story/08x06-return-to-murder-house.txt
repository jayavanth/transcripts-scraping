[BIRDS SINGING]GEORGE: You have to understand,we've had so many weirdos who just want to come inand see this place up close.So, I need to check on a few things,and I'll be right back.There is no way we pull this off.Okay, we look like the worst possible versions of Heidi Klum and Seal.Do you ever stop complaining?I have a right to complain.Okay, the council sent me here because they obviously think I'm expendable.And I had to put khakis on, so it's been a hard day for all of us.So maybe just shut up.GEORGE: All right, Mr. and Mrs. James.[CHUCKLES]The wire transfer went through.All you need to do now is sign.I just can't wait to start making babies in our new home.[CHUCKLES]Well, before you start that, there, there are issues I legally have to make you aware of.This house has been unoccupied for quite some time.Over the past decade alone, there have beenan unprecedented amount of break-ins,missing persons reports.And, of course, the most disturbing...You mean the people that died there?Yeah, we know.About all of them?Uh, what can we say?[LAUGHS]The wife's a sucker for a farmhouse kitchen.Okay, but to be clear, we're not legally liable for any accidents, fatal or otherwise.Other than that, congrats on your new home.Yay.Don't worry, we'll burn some sage.[ALL LAUGH]♪ ♪ What. A. Shithole.♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Oh, so you an obstinate house.Just use the key.[LOCK CLICKS][DOOR CREAKING]Weird.How long did the Realtor say this place has been empty?It looks like someone still lives here.Something definitely lives here.The psychic energy is stronger than anything I've ever felt before.This is not a home, this is a prison.I pity the souls trapped here.It must be hell.I've actually been to Hell.I promise you, this is better.Well, I'm sensing really bad vibes.Maybe we should go clubbing.[SIGHS]If you'd asked me a few years ago, I'd be hitting up my coke dealer right now.But I got a second chance at life.A third chance, actually.I can't f*ck it up.Don't forget who gave you that chance.Do you honestly think Michael is evil?That's what we're here to find out.Cordelia wouldn't send us all this way for no reason.I've never seen this spell before.These spirits do not want to be seen by us.We are trespassers in their home, and if we want to talk to them, we're gonna have to force them out of hiding.Boy Supreme's family died here.If anyone has the goods on Michael, it's them.It's the others I'm worried about.This place is more crowded than a French youth hostel.Who knows what we're walking into?Okay... let's see if this works.My powers have been off since we stepped into this place.Monstra te spirituum.BOTH: Monstra te spirituum.Ne abscondas. Ne abscondas.Ne abscondas![FLOOR CREAKING]Did it work?We're in.[CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER ECHOING][GASPS]Calm down, skinny witch.[LAUGHING]What the f*ck happened in this house?[MADISON PANTING]TATE: I've told you this a million times.You're my psychiatrist. You're supposed to help me.BEN: I have helped you.We've had daily sessions going on for years now.I feel like the only reason you're talking to me is 'cause your wife refuses to talk to you.Let's leave her out of this.Well, then, let's talk about your daughter.'Cause that's what I really need your help with.♪ Sometimes I feel I've got to run away... ♪ Violet, please, talk to me.♪ Get away from the pain that you drive... ♪ You're the only thing I need!It's torture.Can you just talk to her?What do you want me to say?You set fire to your mom's boyfriend, you shot and killed over a dozen kids in high school, you helped kill her parents, plus you impregnated her mother.Any one of those things would be reason enough...I'm different now. Yeah, I'm...You know, I'm dead and-and-and I'm hot, and I know she has feelings for me.You're not so hot.That's right, you can see us, and we can see you.Who are you?I'm Behold Chablis.This is Madison Montgomery.You are Ben Harmon.You killed yourself in this house several years ago after your wife died in childbirth.What are you talking about?I didn't kill myself.I was murdered.What the f*ck is going on here?We decide when we want to be seen.Not anymore.You're looking at two powerful witches.And the spell we cast is just a small demonstration of what we can do.So, if you don't want any more disruptions, you're gonna have to answer some hard questions about Michael Langdon.What are you gonna do, make us more dead?Even people protected by magic aren't safe in this house.I'd watch my ass if I were you.[SIGHS]Look, it's really important.Our coven bought you a goddamn house so nobody will come to bother you ever again.Sorry, you got me at a bad time, I'm busy.You're dead.What do you have to do?I got to look out the window and cry while I m*st*rb*t*.It's my daily thing.Okay, I know it's weird, but I kind of feel for the guy.Should we try to help him?You mean the tear jerker?Ew, no, the other guy.Sounds like he's stuck in a nightmare, trapped in this Amityville reject with the one thing he loves but can never have.It's a romantic tragedy.[BOTH SCREAM]Aah, get the f*ck off of me!- Be gone!- You don't want to do that.You'll have a house full of spirits coming after you, and they aren't all as gentle as this one.Beau, sweetie, you want to play?Play!Who the hell are you?A friend of the house and its residents.They don't take kindly to strangers.You ain't dead?Oh, honey, I'm one of the few live ones they let come and go.And you are Madison Montgomery.Oh, have you seen my movies?- I have fans everywhere.- No.I've known a few Montgomerys in my time, but it's not every day that I see a witch.What are you?Billie Dean Howard, medium to the stars.So, you're like a shitty Ms. Cleo.Excuse me?Now, who do you think you are, coming in here, swanning around, spewing vulgarities?We're the new owners.Who are you?I'm Constance Langdon.And this... is my f*cking house.[CHUCKLES]Well, you two are the most unlikely pair.But, on the plus side, your spawn will have beautiful skin.They're witches, Constance.It's magic, not marriage, that connects them.They won't be moving in.Well, now, that is disappointing.I guess I can't expect you to go running down to the Korean to get me my Crown Royal and Virginia Slims?You drink Crown Royal?You're dead.[BOTH CHUCKLE]It's true that this side of the mortal coil makes it impossible to get a good buzz going, but, well, old habits die hard.[WOMAN CLEARS THROAT]It's done.As demanded, the living room has been tidied yet again.We'll see about that.I won't be but a moment.It'll be more than a moment.Oh.[CHUCKLES]Do you know what this is on the tip of my finger?It appears to be some dust that I missed.No, it's my sense of wonder.Why, it-it's the color of my piqued curiosity, it...Oh, will you just get on with it?Just because we're trapped here for eternity doesn't mean you have to jabber on forever to make a point.Tell me, little Miss Moira, If you're going to be an old maid for all eternity, why not be a decent one, hmm?[LAUGHS]My real work, my avocation, if you will, isn't dusting, it's satisfying your husband in the basement.Be careful.My mother told me pettiness causes wrinkles.So does cruelty.Disappointment makes a woman bitter.And when I think of all of the unfulfilled dreams that you left behind when you took the coward's way out, well, I guess I'd be pretty miffed at the world, too.You ladies all right in here?It is so hard to find good help.That poor woman.In a house filled with tragedy, she might be the saddest soul of all.- Oh, shut up.- All right.Look, we need the hot goss on a guy who used to live here, uh, Michael Langdon.We have nothing to say about him.You did raise him, correct?I said we're not talking.Oh, pipe down, Billie.I know more about that boy than any woman, dead or alive.But I don't spill a drop of tea for free, kiddos.Self-interest, hmm.That's something I can get behind.What do you want?To remove that insufferable cloudy-eyed ginger from these premises permanently.You want us to fire the help?Well, if you really do have witchcraft at your disposal, then why don't you just abracadabra that goddamn bitch out of my afterlife, huh?Bless me with some peace and quiet.And then we can talk about Michael all you want.Got something!Ah!Nope.Not hers.It's got a totally different vibration.Moira's bones would be much more morose.You know this is ridiculous, right?This place has more bodies buried than the catacombs in Rome.If Constance wants us to get rid of the maid, I know a spell that can easily bind her to the closet.She'll never have to see her again.Keep digging.Ah!You have an enemy.I'm proud to say I have many.You can't live with virtue without getting on the bad side of those without.Constance hates your guts.She won't talk to us unless we put you away.Out of sight forever.What are you going to do to me?[GASPS]Oh, heavens be.My bones.I can't begin to thank you.These bones are my means to escape.Oh, thank you, thank you.[WHISPERING]: Thank you.Thank you.Okay.Okay, you're getting slobber on my clothes.- [SNIFFS, CLEARS THROAT]- Moira.You have a choice.Where do you want to be buried?There's only one place I've ever wanted to be.How original, to be buried in a cemetery.Her wish was to be close to her mother.I want my bones to be buried at the studio.Paramount, Stage .I would gladly haunt the sh1t out of that place.It's where they made me do my first nude scene.Totally gratuitous.I begged for a body double, but the asshole producer wanted to get his rocks off, so...You surprised me.Under the facade of a heartless narcissist...Is a stone-cold bitch.Listen, warlock, I wouldn't think twice about slitting your throat if I thought it would get me out of that house a second sooner with the answers.Duly warned.[BOTH SIGH]♪ ♪ Oh, Mother.Your hands.They're as beautiful as I remembered.What's wrong?I have to confess something.I killed you.I pulled the plug on the respirator because I couldn't bear leaving you in that horrible nursing home.Can you ever forgive me?Darling, I wanted to smother you with kisses.I was in agony, and you gave me peace.- Oh.- Oh.It's beautiful here.I feel like I can finally breathe.♪ ♪MADISON: We did what you asked.Moira's gone,- so you can start any time now.- Shh...I was just savoring the stillness.Not only was that woman the worst maid in God's creation, but she would never shut up.Death only made her more verbose.Tell us about Michael.Well...he was born right here in this house to a mother and a family ultimately marked for death.[SCREAMS]♪ ♪ When his mother diedpushing him out into the world,I gladly assumed the burdenof raising him.You see, I-I-I am a mother myself, four times over.- [CHUCKLES]- Why you?Because he also happened to be my grandson.His father was that handsome young man in the sweater and the mop top that you saw when you first came in...Tate.Now I am the first to admit that, um, there were mistakes made raising Tate.And that's why, with Michael...Oh, my God...He was such a perfectlittle angel of light.I thought that would be my chance for a do-over.You see, I was born to be a mother.I always felt that, to raise a great man,that was the most admirable and selfless acta woman could aspire to.He was my destiny.Oh, such a beautiful child,with such a cheerful disposition.Even when he was committing unspeakable acts.What do you mean unspeakable?Oh, it was trivial at first, of course, you know.I'd find dead flies in his crib with their wings shorn off and...And then, as he got older... small rodents.I had seen enough Discovery Channel specials to know exactly what evolutionary tree he was shimmying up.
