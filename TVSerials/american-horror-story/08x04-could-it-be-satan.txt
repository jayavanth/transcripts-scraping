LANGDON: She was the closest personI ever had to a mother.To this day, I don't know how she found me.I was glad to finally find a real home.Aren't you forgetting something?Bless us, Dark Lord, for these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy infernal bounty, through the power of Lucifer Eternal.Nema.I swear, the only other person who liked this as much as you was my first husband.And that's why it was so easy to poison him.You're not gonna poison me, are you?Not if you clean your room, like I asked you to.You didn't really kill your first husband, did you?No.I killed my first three husbands.[CHUCKLES]You might as well learn this now.If something isn't working, it's best to just cut the cord.And make sure the insurance policy's up to date.That's evil.Hell yeah.I'm a devil mama.[BOTH LAUGH]LANGDON: She made me feel happy and protected.So you can understand why I gave you her form and her thoughts.I need someone to help me with the monumental task of remaking this world.Who better than the one person I never stopped trusting or loving?Your jacket is stained.So it is.There's another one in the dresser.What do you think?- Hail Satan.- Not quite.But I appreciate the sentiment.Ms.Mead, I do believe you're glowing.For the first time, I feel I know my place in the world.By your side.[LAUGHS SOFTLY]What is it?A powerful presence.What do you mean?Everyone's dead.Not anymore.[PANTING QUIETLY]I don't know what's going on.MADISON: Bad news, bitch.You're back from the dead.- I'm what?- CORDELIA: Just breathe deeply.You need time to get your bearings.MYRTLE: Poor dear, to be raised up and released from an Identity Spell at the same moment.I cannot believe Brock shoved a knife through my head.That f*cking b*st*rd better hope he's dead.Wow.She's by far the weakest among us and seems to be handling it the best.People react to spells in different ways.I think the perfect antidote to stoke the blood and speed up the recovery process would be a spicy gazpacho Andaluz.You think the kitchen here has a spice rack?Can someone please tell me what's going on?What do you mean, Identity Spell?We placed it on you, for your protection.Coco, too.It kept you from knowing your true self.Why?Because you're special, Mallory.And we need you.We need all of you.You're on your own with that sh1t.I made a billion dollars in TV, and all I ever did was straddle the fence.I'm sure as hell not dumping that strategy here, sisters.I haven't promised anything.I haven't signed anything.And I'm not here to defeat anyone.Who cares?As if you could ever defeat anyone with that backwards voodoo sh1t.LANGDON: How can any of you defeat me, when I've already won?You haven't won.Perhaps you haven't noticed the state of the world.It's almost as bad as your dinner jacket.But at least the world can be saved.By you?- By all of us.- Hey.Get the wax out of your ears.I'm here to watch.But I'm not.Just don't let me die again, okay?It really sucked the first time.LANGDON: When I'm done, you'll all wish you were still dead.I always thought the world would end with fire and ice, not witches and warlocks.♪ ♪ ♪ ♪[CLATTERING, CREAKING IN DISTANCE][INDISTINCT CHATTER][CHANTING]: Igneme accende. Igneme accende.[CHANTING]: Ex forma mutata. Summa partes.BEHOLD: Remember, gentlemen, a spell is much more than a series of arcane words.But it is the power you bring to those words that makes the magic.Summa partes. Ex forma mutata...Mr. Banks.If you ever expect to rise beyond Level One, you will arrive on time.If punctuality is too taxing for you, join the Magic Castle and do card tricks with Neil Patrick Harris.I'm sorry, sir.And you forgot your book......again.[CHANTING CONTINUES QUIETLY]Now let's see if you've been practicing your spells, or just fiddling with your wand.Ex forma mutata.Facti sunt figura novi.- Good.Keep going.- [CHANTING CONTINUES]Your power is molecular.Woven into your DNA.See every atom.Rearrange them.Transform them.Ex forma mutata. Facti sunt figura novi.Facti sunt figura novi.Ex forma mutata.

you to be stinking up my office with that cancer stick.I thought you quit.I quit every week.You might need one after you've seen what I've seen.Please allow our colleagues to make their own unbiased evaluation.Ariel.Nobody told us you were coming.I'll make arrangements for a celebration tonight.The students can meet their Grand Chancellor.No.There is something much more pressing.This was sent to me by a sympathetic member of the Los Angeles Police Department.Does that help with your memory?PERP: I didn't do anything.Except stab him with five knives.You were the only one there, you sick little f*ck.I didn't touch those knives.You won't find my fingerprints anywhere.Oh...[GRUNTING][GRUNTING, GASPING][INDISTINCT SHOUTING]- [CRUNCHING]- [SCREAMING]Save me.Need a smoke?Holy sh1t.It's a classic case of demonic possession.Ariel, as much as you want him to be, the boy is not a warlock.He's not the provocateur.Look at him.I disagree.I think it was a-a manifestation of wild energy.It was out of control but full of potency and promise.Let's just say that you're right and he was responsible.Then his magic is dark and volatile, and we should leave him the f*ck alone.Protection of our kind has become a matter of life and death.Warlocks have always been second-class citizens.That doesn't mean that we have to open our doors to just anyone, especially him.ARIEL: This school gave us direction.His power can be harnessed for good.He could be the one we've been waiting for.Remember the prophecy.You're talking about the Alpha.The warlock who becomes the Alpha will have power beyond comprehension.His magic will exceed that of the witches.He could pass the test of the Seven Wonders.And supplant their Supreme.The Alpha will allow us to take our rightful place at the top of the hierarchy.Behold, what do you think?I think you need to get a face-to-face with that boy.GUARD: Wake up.There's somebody here to see you.[SIGHS]You're not a lawyer.I'm a friend.I don't have any friends.I think maybe I can help you, Michael, if you let me.I saw the tape of your interview with the detective.It was impressive.I'm not with the police or social services or any part of the government.I'm a warlock...and I think you're one.A warlock?Your whole life, things have occurred around you that you can't explain.Maybe it was just a...a fleeting thought you had.An impulse.A moment of rage.But then it happened.Like magic.A warlock is someone who can control that magic.When that detective was hurting you, what went through your mind?- Nothing.- No.You were frightened and angry, so you lashed out the only way you could.You made some awful thoughts come true.I just wanted him to get away.How did you end up in here?I was defending someone.[SNIFFS]Actually, the only person who's never betrayed me.You're not understanding what I want.I don't want goat meat.I want a goat's head.I need it for my incantations.Lady, I can't sell you that.Why?Are you only butchering headless goats?I'm not giving you the head for some insane sh1t.You're discriminating against my religious beliefs, Mr. Butcher Man.Where's your manager?I'm gonna talk to your manager.You are rude.Don't ever talk to her like that.[CHUCKLING]: Yeah?f*ck you.And f*ck that batshit crazy bitch.[ELECTRICAL BUZZING]I never wanted to hurt anyone.Michael, your life is about to begin.Time for us to go.[DOOR UNLATCHES, SQUEAKS]What the hell are you doing?You said you just wanted to talk to him.He's innocent of all charges.I'm taking him with me.He's not going anywhere.[GROANS][LAUGHING]: That was awesome!He'll probably wet his pants, but he'll be released unharmed when we're gone.Oh, I'm sure he won't feel a thing.[GUARD GASPING][BONES SNAPPING]I'm a true believer, Michael.I'll be here for you.Always.- [ENGINE STARTS]- Hail the new world.Hail.Hail the new world.Boy's gonna make me proud someday.- This place is underground?- It wasn't always.An actual building stood here once.It was beautiful, with big wooden beams and giant glass windows that let you see forever.Problem was we could see out, but others could see in.In , when Miss Cordelia went on her publicity tour and outed us to the world, some locals decided they didn't want us in their neighborhood.They threw a little Molotov cocktail party and burned everything down.All that was left standing was the sculpture from the garden.So we went underground again.Literally.Shall we?I'd like you all to meet Michael.Like many of us when we first arrived, he is not sure that this is the place for him.But in the days to come, we're going to show him that not only is this the only place he belongs, but that he's finally found his true home.[INDISTINCT GREETINGS]ARIEL: Now that you've had time to settle and you've immersed yourself in the study of magic here at the coven, it's time to evaluate and see where you stand.Normally, this would happen at the end of the first year.Well, I've only been here a month.Well, seeing your progress, we feel justified in accelerating the process.To begin, each warlock at our school is assigned a level, one through four, according to their talents and the breadth of their powers.Are you all level fours?Sadly, you're looking at a bunch of threes.Sixes after a few cocktails.A level four would mean a warlock that is categorically as powerful as the female Supreme.He would be the one we call the Alpha.We shouldn't burden the boy with theory.In the history of the coven, there's never been a level four warlock.Let's see if he can pass level one.BALDWIN: Scrying is the ability to see things in a reflective surface.Messages, visions, prophecies.But today, we're not looking for the next Nostradamus.All you need to do is to tell us where we hid a particular book.- The New...- The New Adam and Eve.By Hawthorne.- First edition.- Yes.[EXHALES]Well, that'll get some extra credit.Tremendous.He was only tasked with telling us where the book was hidden.Even you have to admit that was impressive.Impressive.And troubling.Quite simply, he ignored directions.Salire per spatium.The ability to transport yourself instantly throughout physical space.Just pick a spot in the room, envision yourself there, and make it happen.What are those things for?Motivation.LANGDON: Anything else?You want me to dust up here?BALDWIN: This final test requires an understanding not only of magic, but of nature.Stiricidium.JOHN HENRY: Molecules of water are all around us.Change the weather inside this room, and turn the water into snow.[INHALES DEEPLY, EXHALES][WHOOSHING][WHOOSHING][THUNDEROUS WHOOSH][LAUGHTER]BEHOLD: Beautiful!Wow.[WIND WHIPPING][COUGHING, GASPING]I can't breathe.[GRUNTING, GASPING][WHIMPERS]Enough![WHEEZING, COUGHING]I'm sorry.I didn't know that was inside of me.You're testing your wings.Once you're fully in control of your powers, you'll have the confidence to soar.Thank you for your spirited participation, Michael.You've given us a lot to consider.Everyone in this room can do some of what he did.Not a single one of us can do it all.He crushed every test, surpassed all our expectations.He is the most powerful warlock I've ever seen, and I've seen a few.The witches' dominion over us will soon be a thing of the past.JOHN HENRY: Are you serious?He almost killed us.Can't you see that there is a malevolence to his magic?To him?We should be afraid.You can't corral the darkness.Don't be afraid of Michael.Be afraid of the status quo.Be afraid to do nothing.We have an obligation to our kind, to our future, to see if he can rise and lead us to our rightful place.
