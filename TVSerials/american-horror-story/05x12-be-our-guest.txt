Liz: We started with such high hopes. With all the previous owners being dead, the hotel was under new management-- ours. We were determined to remake the Cortez in our own image. This would be no mere hotel. We had ambitions to be a family to the friendless, a comfort to those in the cold, a beehive of acceptance. It was supposed to be the perfect ending.Oh, hello. Hello.Welcome to the Cortez.Please, sign our guest book.Sure.May I offer the two of you a glass of champagne?Ooh.Don't mind if I do.Ah.(whispering): I think those are the reviewers from that Internet site, Trip Adventurers.They must've heard about our grand reopening.I know.Can't you see the ridiculously gracious smile plastered on my face?What is that pungent odor?Sage. To cleanse the spirit.I'll show you to your room.(elevator bell dings)Liz: To polish the jewel that is the Cortez, it required not only money-- which we got from liquidating the Countess's numerous pieces of art-- it was going to take four stars on the Internet. And so, we were off.We haven't finished with every floor, but this is one of our newly refreshed rooms.Egyptian cotton.400 thread count.Minibar?Mixers are on the house.If there's anything else you need, just pick up the phone.Thank you.Enjoy your stay.And you were ready to give it a pass.Kill me.(chuckles)(gasps)Are you kidding?That's a Toto Neorest 700H, baby.The Japanese self-cleaning wonder toilet.(sighs): Oh.(laughs)I have always wanted to try one of these.Sally: Doesn't it just make you want to take a dump?Who the hell are you?How did you get in here?(Sally sighs)I got to say, it's a nice room.They spent every penny they had to change everything they could.They took out the mattresses, especially the ones I split open.Took out the carpets, soaked through with so many years of piss and blood.They even changed the furniture.But you know what they couldn't take out?The pain.'Cause I'm still here.All right, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.Now.Hey.Oh! God!(gasping)Oh, God! Oh, God!Call the police!Some crazy bitch just killed my partner!Please... ah!Oh, my God. Oh!Oh, God.Please, you got to help me!No, no. You have to help me.I'm new at this murder game, and, Jesus Christ, is it a thrill.Ah, crap.We got another one down at the end of the hallway.Damn it.This has got to stop.He stained the new carpet.Yeah, we got a serious problem.The ghosts keep killing the guests, we're gonna end up with zero stars.It's time we had a goddamn meeting.Hello! Welcome!Thank you all for coming.Marcy: Excuse me.My understanding is that you two are in charge now, and I'd like to speak to you about changing my room.Liz: Sweetheart, you're a ghost.You can choose whatever room you'd like.Marcy: Well, yes, but the problem is, after I pick a room and then settle in with my erotica novels, I never know if a guest is going to check in and disturb me.I know this is Los Angeles, but I'm an old-fashioned girl and I like my privacy.Stephen: I dig it when the guests come in.It's like a free dirty movie.I'm into that amateur stuff.(chuckles)Are you three, like, a thing now?Vendela: Ya.We try dating the lumberjack, but he's a gay.Iris: Okay, everyone, please, listen.This is important, and it affects every single one of you.We would like you to stop killing the guests.(laughs)(murmuring)Liz: It's not all of you, but we are trying to build something special here.A real... destination.Look, they're gonna get two football teams down in Carson.That's 20 minutes down the 110.This place could be filled.But if it gets out that people are checking in and disappearing, then obviously, that's bad for business.Screw you, Iris.You're the biggest killer in this room, you bloodsucker.Iris: Maybe in the past.But every drop of blood I drink now is donated.Any murders that go on in this hotel are done by your kind.Excuse me, but... what do you mean by "our kind"?Sally: Can we all just call a spade a spade and say you're talking about Will and I?I mean, Woo is too busy munching on Swedish fish to bother anyone.Marcy molests herself or complains all day.The lumberjack just mopes.And that hipster couple just trips around moaning about for kale.Will and I are the only ones who still get off on a little bit of true mischief.And we're not stopping.Ending some jerk-off who wastes the air that he breathes?That is the real high.I'm dead, but I've never felt more alive.Ha.(slow clapping)Beautifully said.And I couldn't agree more.But I must come down on the side of Cleopatra and her friend on this issue.Sally: Oh, come on!You telling people to stop killing is like Colonel Sanders telling us to stop eating chicken.I'm not familiar with your military friend and his fondness for poultry, but my killing days are over.I thought the Ten Commandment killings were the beginning of my work, but it turns out that they are the epilogue.The torch has been passed, and I feel complete.But this is a practical decision, not an emotional one.This is our home.Frankly, it's the only one we've got.None of us know what is waiting for us beyond this place if it no longer stands.Perhaps, without these walls to protect us, we would all be forced to move on and face the judgment of our Maker.If we can't stay in business, all bets are off.We'll have to sell.Or get evicted.Will: That's bullshit.I paid cash for this place.My lawyers will keep paying the upkeep and the taxes for as long as they have the funds.Yeah, well, that's not gonna take very long, cowboy.Sure, your business was worth a fortune when you were alive.But you're such a narcissist that you never brought anyone else in to design your lines.And when you disappeared, they had zilch.Now the whole shithouse has gone up in flames.Your stock is worth pennies.That is bullshit!You're a goddamn liar.Enough! This is not a democracy!We are not in the House of Lords!We are a ship at sea!And when it comes to you spirits, I am captain!So listen up, mateys!There are six criteria that the U.S. Department of Interior uses to determine if a place is worthy of being called an historical landmark.This hotel fits them all.The one thing it does not yet possess is time.Age.August 23, 2026.That will make it 100 years that this hotel has stood.And on that day, it will earn its rightful distinction as an historical landmark.They won't be able to tear it down even if they wanted to.The killing must stop!Sally: Oh, hell no.Some of us can't go out into the world to find companionship, so I'm not gonna stop collecting souls until I find my soul mate.March: Sally, I don't want to get rough with you, but you and I both know there is a way to get you to do as I please.Or do you not recall the last time you disobeyed me?(muffled screaming, drill whirring)So, it's settled, then.The point of being dead is that there are no rules.It's the only salvation.Who gives a sh1t if they tear this place down and send us all straight to hell?It can't be any worse!(spits)(knocking on door)Go away!Complimentary bottle of champagne for our VIP long-term residents.That's you, missy.Save your breath.I know what you're up to.Your Kumbaya intrigues might work with the others; they're not gonna work with me.Good.We can cut the crap.Jesus, you're one lonely, miserable bitch.Oh, there she is.Now get the hell out of my room.Don't you ever get tired of being so goddamn bitter?I want to help you, Sally.This coming from the woman who shoved me out of a window.Okay.That's on me.I'm sorry.Truly.But it's no good for either of us to dwell in the past.Honey, you haven't been the same since John left.Watch it, Iris.I can still take an ice pick to your throat, anytime.You loved him.The only way you knew how.He turned his back on you, after all you'd done for him.I know how that feels.You don't know a damn thing about how I feel.About my pain.The only thing that takes the edge off is when I can pull people under with me.Make them feel one ounce of what I feel.Then I'm not alone.But don't you see?All those people you've been killing, it's... they're just Band-Aids.What if I knew of a more permanent fix?You could have something long-lasting.A future.What future?I'm dead.You've been living in a 1994 world.Times have changed.The Cortez is proud to offer free Wi-Fi now in every room.Here's your ticket to adventure.Go on, open it.What am I supposed to do with this?We can't change the past, but you can choose to move forward and live.So what?I-I'm gonna be the ghost in the machine?That's exactly what you're gonna be.Okay, look.I loaded it up for you with Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. You don't need to be out in the world to be a part of it.In the modern age, no one ever has to be alone.Even for a second.There's a whole world out there waiting to embrace you, Sally.Come on, all you have to do is dive in.(phone vibrates)♪Liz: Sally took to the interwebs like a fish to water.It was as if everything she did shot out a pulse of electricity. And from all the corners of the globe, people responded.(phone vibrates)In droves, tingling for more. A rapt audience welcoming her with open arms, desperate to connect, hanging onto her every word.Suddenly the girl no one wanted became the belle of the ball. She could say anything, bare her soul. Her lone voice weaving into its own cyber subculture. A safe harbor.♪ It spits you out when you desire ♪
♪ Conquer it to feel you're higher... ♪As she basked in sublime adoration, being numb to the world finally lost its appeal.♪Another?How long have I been dead?It's over a year now.How long does it feel like?Like I don't exist.Is that why you've been acting out and killing those people?I had no idea that my business was dead.(chuckles)Oh, it's not dead. It's dying.Well, what have they done with it?Factories?The stores on Rodeo, Fifth Avenue?Well, they shuttered the couture division.The perfumes and sunglasses are keeping everything else afloat.And you do matter in the world, you know.As long as it lives and your son thrives, you matter.I'm grateful for what you've done for him.Thatcher is one of the best schools in the country, and Ojai is year-round divine.You should let him come and visit you.No. No.This is no place for a young man.(chuckles)All of the death here.I don't want him to be poisoned by it.Even if it breaks my heart that I can't see him.May I make a proposition?You're beautiful, but you're not my type.(laughs)The trapped spirits in this place who aren't in perpetual misery understand that if you want to feel the magic of cause and effect, you have to have a purpose.Your fashion house was iconic.You're iconic.My fashion house was headed for disaster long before I "disappeared."I haven't had an original thought in a decade.This is California!The land of reinvention.I mean, look what this place did for me.Where does everyone even think I am?Rumors abound.Rehab, madness, illness.Each one more scandalous than the last.Frankly, it's marvelous publicity.People love a mystery.Sketch.Create.Be part of the world again.Running a fashion house is more than sketching.More than any other business, a line needs a face.(chuckles): Okay.I was a salesman in another life.In this one, I'm the mother of style.Cut me and I bleed Dior.And you don't have to be dead, you know.So you decided to hole up in your happy place, like Howard Hughes without the crazy.(whispers): We can do this!Liz: Stepping into the boardroom atop a pair of five-inch Guccis, well, that teaches the authority this business needed.You have to balance your frame, consider each step, and lean into your momentum. You wind up elevated.Gentlemen, I'm Liz Taylor.Mr. Drake has sent me here to lead this company into the future.Until Mr. Drake has the courtesy to appear before this board himself...Mr. Vice-Chairman, I can assure you that Will Drake has granted me full authority to act on his behalf.
