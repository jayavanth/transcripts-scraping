(LOCK BUZZES)KAI: Who do you hate the most in the world?GLORIA: Danvers, the warden.That "better than everyone" attitude, and those dirty f*cking eyeglasses.Take them off and clean them, asshole.Authority.You're not a woman who likes to be told what to do.That depends on who's doing the telling.Open your shirt.Show me them biker chick titties.- JIMBO: Kai!- (CHUCKLES)Speak of the devils.The three of us need to take a walk.It's all right, Gloria.It's all right.(LOCK BUZZES)(WATER RUNNING)What'd you gentlemen like to talk...(GASPS)Your silver tongue bullshit's f*cking with the natural order.(KAI GROANS)Cons like to keep it simple.You got the Bloods and the Crips for the blacks, however many cockroach spic gangs for the wetbacks, and for the white Europeans, you got the Nazi Lowriders and the Aryan Brotherhood.Could you maybe write all that down for me?I didn't bring my notepad.(GROANS)Can you do me just one favor?After you kill me, can you send a letter to my girlfriend?She's the best piece of ass I've ever had.You're serious?It's the least you could do.f*ck it.Sure.What's her name and address?(CHUCKLES)I don't understand.You don't know your own mother's name and address?(BOTH GRUNTING)(SHOUTS)(GAGGING)(YELLS)(GASPS)(COUGHING)Ah.Nice work, Crotchy.- Thank you, Divine Ruler.- (EXHALES)Is it what you wanted?It's perfect.My little pointy-headed ticket out of here.You should probably break the news to old ginger snap about his ticket to ride.Crotchy...I'm sure when you helped me orchestrate all this, you realized that people were gonna wonder why you survived and your shithead friend didn't.You're what we like to call a "loose end." And for what I've got to do, there's no room for loose ends.I'm going to have to kill you.You will be a martyr to the cause.It's an honor, Divine Ruler.My sweet boy.You are the illest m*therf*cker alive!Thank you, Chuck.- (WHOOPS)- Now let's get down to business.We have more corpses in our future.♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (INDISTINCT CHATTER)Hey, beat it, you little piece of sh1t.Will you please just let me talk to him?KAI: Scooter, let him through.Take a seat, son.Thank you, Divine Ruler.- My name is...- Trevor Geary.Age , serving years.- Am I right?- How do you know that?I'm not a strong man, Trevor.Not compared to the monsters in this place.I realized my first month that if I wanted to survive, I had to make it my business to know everything about everyone.months later, my movement is men strong.Raise your pinky.We're connected now, Trevor.Obligated to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but.Like being under oath.Got it?Yeah.You need protection.Yes.I get the sh1t kicked out of me every day.I've only been here a month.I'm gonna die here unless...You're a coward.What?You killed a kid with your dad's Tesla, driving drunk.And you dumped the child's body in a reservoir.That makes you a coward.- Say it.- Yeah.I'm a coward.But I'll do anything to join your gang.This isn't a gang.It's an army.These are my soldiers, and this place is a fertile breeding ground.While women destroy the world outside, we wait safely for our time to strike.Whatever, man.I'm just...I'm just so scared.Do you swear to devote yourself fully to me and my cause, and to never question me?Yes.I f*cking swear it.Good.We will protect you on a probationary basis.- (SIGHS)- Men, welcome our new brother.(TREVOR SIGHS)(SIGHS)How the hell did a man like you end up here?Same as any of these guys.I was sold out by a filthy...f*cking... rat.He's still not picking up!Where the f*ck is he?Hey.Speedwagon hasn't missed a single gathering, - and he's never even been late.- Get off the phone.f*ck, I don't have time for this sh1t.There's too much to do.- Open up.- We got to get started.They're waiting for you.(KAI INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY)Give me that.Okay.A little bad news to start.It turns out finding , pregnant women to murder...Super hard.No one will ever accuse me of lacking ambition.So...Night of a Thousand Tates is off.(MEN SIGH)But...Night of One Hundred Tates is on.MEN: Yes!Look under your chairs.Ally's handed each of you a unique list of targets, all ready to pop.You raise your hand one more f*cking time, and I will cut it off.How do we know they're all pregnant?Because Gutterball pulled the rosters of four ob-gyns, two Lamaze classes and a Momtra Yoga over on Main.Great job, Gutterball.Manson's family...I admire 'em, but they did get a little sloppy.Their message got lost in their mess.What we are doing requires more precision.It is imperative that both mother and child are impaled.Don't f*ck this up!Aim for the belly button, but stab in a downward motion.If you stab straight, you miss the baby, and our entire message is lost.Tomorrow night, when your blades tear open pregnant bellies, you will be releasing a power into the universe.Detonating a neutron bomb of truth, blood and amniotic fluid.You will be galvanizing an army!With their sisters gutted, women everywhere will be forced to react.They can't ignore an injustice this brutal.They'll have to rise up, and in their collective rage, they will train it on Senator Jackson, on all incumbents, on any of the people in power who failed to keep us safe.As the most vulnerable are slaughtered, as the pregnant bodies pile up on Senator Jack-off's watch, we will be surfing an electoral bloodbath straight to Capitol Hill.And then...the White House.(MEN VOICING ASSENT)Now, ready your melons, boys.And...kill!Kill!Kill!Kill!Exciting night, isn't it?- Yes.- Hmm.The Divine Ruler's wisdom is an inspiration.I'm very privileged to be making this watermelon and feta salad, a glorious recycling of the Night of a Hundred Tates practice session.- (LOUD CHOPPING)- Nothing goes to waste with this amazing crew.- (CHOPPING)- (QUIETLY): Beverly...BEVERLY: I can't do this anymore.I'm done.I wanted to be the last person alive.But...I just want to die.Now.Kill me.Ally, please.I'm begging you.I helped ruin your life.If Kai told me to, I would have killed you and gotten a cheeseburger right after.Beverly.We all did what we had to do.And we still are.That hasn't changed.What's happening tomorrow night will be glorious.You'll see.I know it's hard when you've lost your faith to find it again.Believe me, I know.But just hang on a little while longer.KAI: Where the hell are you, Speedwagon?I'm freaking out, man.Call me back as soon as you get this.f*ck.My sister probably turned him in to the Feds, that goddamn rat!Kai, will you relax?Let me make you a Manwich.f*ck a Manwich!We got to call it off!Oh, Christ.They're probably tracing my phone!Hey!Hey, Kai, look at me.Hey, hey.Shh.Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.- What?- Calm down.Shh, shh, shh.Take a deep breath.(KAI INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY)It is all going to be fine.How can you say that?!(PANTING)I need to show you something.Come on.What?I've been trying to find the right way to tell you.Goddamn it!I knew it!I knew we'd been compromised.Where was it?How did you get this?I found it two days ago.You left us exposed for two days?Why didn't you tell me sooner?I was afraid, Kai.Afraid of what?Afraid of what, Ally?!I was afraid what happened would break your heart.ALLY: Hello, Speedwagon.sh1t!sh1t.(PANTING)Please, you can't tell Kai.Who the hell are you?Are you a cop?- (COUGHING): No.- You FBI?No.No, I do data processing for a hospital.The cops busted me heading to a rave with ecstasy pills in my bag.They were gonna lock me up for five years.They knew Samuels was dirty.They told me, if I could infiltrate the gang and get information on him, they'd drop all the charges.But they had no idea, no clue about Kai and all the crazy cult sh1t we've been up to.Once they did, they made me stay in and get more.So you're just working for the state police?Isn't that enough?He's gonna kill me.Look what he just did to his goddamn sister!Are the cops listening in on us right now?Can you call for help?No, it doesn't work like that.This thing is just a recorder, not a transmitter.Okay, good.(LOUD, RASPY BREATHING)Shh.Take a deep breath.- Okay.- It's gonna be okay.(GROANS)ALLY: Winter was innocent.She didn't betray me?No, Kai.Your sister never betrayed you.It was Speedwagon all this time.He set her up, Kai.He fooled us all.(KAI SIGHS)(KAI GROANS)Fu...!(CRYING): Oh, God!(SOBBING)Shh.Shh, shh.What have I done?Oh...I'm so sorry.It's okay.I killed her.I killed her over nothing.(KAI SNIFFLES)You listen to me.- You can give her death meaning.- (CRIES)You can channel this rage, become the leader she wanted you to be.Be the man that she believed in.You can finish what you both started.(KAI SNIFFLES)You carry out your plan tomorrow night, and you smack this country out of its desiccated stupor and build the world you wanted for her.For all of us.You can do it.I know you can.KAI: Tonight is the night.Open your backpacks.We're going to assemble your kill kits.Ka-Bar.- ALL: Check!- A change of clothes.Bring your bloody clothes back with you to be burned - in the victory bonfire.- ALL: Check!Chloroform and a rag to soak it in.This is especially important for you guys dealing with multiple targets - like the Lamaze class.- ALL: Check!What about their husbands?Shock and awe.They die first.ALL: Check!KAI: Listen to me.The most important thing is not in the kill kit.It's inside you.Are you able and willing - to die for our cause?- ALL: Check!Are you ready to make history?Yeah!Hoorah!Divine Ruler!Hoorah!Divine Ruler!Hoorah!Divine Ruler!Hoorah!Divine Ruler...(CHANTING CONTINUES)Fortify yourselves with some vitamin A!(CHEERING)Where are you going?I'm just going to get some snacks.Go!Go now!MAN: I don't get this map sh1t.Can I just put the address in my phone?KAI: Yes, Sandstorm.Get there any way you know how.Divine Ruler, did you send Ally...FBI.You're under arrest.m*therf*cker.(EXPLOSIONS)(MUTED SHOUTING)(GUNFIRE)(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)(GUNSHOT)(GUNSHOT)No!You were right, Ally.I just had to hang on.Rat!You bitch!I'll f*cking kill you!Ah...You bitch!You f*cking bitch!I'll kill you!I'll kill you!Hello guys, how are you?Everything to your satisfaction?- Oh, yes.Our meals are perfect.- Wonderful.Better than ever.I hate to impose, a-and I'm sure you get this every day, but...can I take a picture with you?I read about what you had to go through, escaping from that cult.I think you're one of the most inspiring women of our time.Well, that is very flattering.Thank you.I only wish it were true.You know, I'd really rather not take that picture.I'm just...I'm trying to put all that behind me.Oh, of course.But thank you so much for coming in, and I hope you enjoy your food.ALLY: Hello...Just one.Sorry, we're completely booked for the evening.Ally.What's a girl got to do to get a table around here?You must have heard.Kai pled guilty to everything.He's not going to trial.That doesn't surprise you?Why do you care?Because I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.Why didn't he turn me in?They took me in the night of the raid, then let me go.Not another word since.Beverly, you didn't fit the profile.A black woman in a cult of angry white nationalists?They thought you were an unwilling victim.You were the informant.Is that what you told them?I told them the truth.I didn't see that you were involved in any crime, except being subservient to those misogynistic assholes.That still doesn't explain what Kai did, or didn't do.The DA offered a plea.He waives a trial to save himself from the death penalty.He's such a narcissist, he couldn't bear to have anyone else take credit.You got to admit it's driving you crazy, waiting for him to turn on you.How did you get so lucky to come out smelling like a rose?ALLY: The FBI came to see me when Vincent put me in the psychiatric ward.
