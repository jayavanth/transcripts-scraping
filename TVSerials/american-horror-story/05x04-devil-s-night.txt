Please stop!(knocking)Who is it?It's John Lowe from downstairs.Oh!I'm busy!I'm working on these sheets!What happened here? Was there an accident?It happens every year.At this time.I-I lost my boy on Halloween.So every year I go a little mad and I make a mess of everything.And I can't get a-a handle on the sheet situation.You lost your boy?You mean he died?Not right away.How did you lose him?I didn't see!I wasn't paying attention!(crying): It was my fault!I should've made him a proper costume, like all the children.I know how that feels, especially around the anniversary.I-I made him wear a plain old sheet.Just a plain old sheet.Why didn't I pay more attention?!I'm not really sure.I feel like I'm living in a walking nightmare.Would you like a sherry?I'm okay, thank you.I'll let you get back...Will-will you pour me one?Talking with you is a comfort to my soul.They searched the city for days.But he wasn't in the city.His killer... took him to his ranch up in Wineville.(chickens clucking)Oh, God, help me!He haunts my dreams.His woeful eyes pierce me with accusations.Why weren't you careful Mommy?Didn't you love me, Mommy?(crying)Of course I loved him!At least you know what happened to your boy.But I don't.Not really.This is all we found of your boy, ma'am.That sicko disposed of all their bodies in quicklime.And then he scattered their bones in a mass grave.Oh...(screams)They never were sure exactly how many children there were.That is a terrible story, Ms...Evers.Hazel Evers.You can call me Hazel.I'm John.I know.I have a confession to make, John.I've known for a while that we were kindred spirits.(laughing)Oh, my!Oh, my, it's so late and I'm so behind!There's so much to do before the shindig tonight, and so little time!The master will be very very upset if his table isn't perfect.His autumnal banquet is the event of the year.These particular guests, they're very demanding.Refills, refills, refills!My feet are swollen up like puff pastries by the end of the night!(barking)Jasper, stop that.Come here, come here.Jasper, come on.In here.(Jasper growls)He's a sweet dog.He just doesn't know who you are.We got him two years ago.Your sister was lonely.I'm gonna do an exam.It'll only take a minute, okay?It's too bright.Sorry.I'm sorry. Come over here, baby.Can you sit still for me?(thermometer beeps)Do you feel cold?No.No?Do you know where you are, baby?Hmm? Do you remember this house?You're home.You're finally home, baby.Oh, I've missed you so much.I'm thirsty.Of course you are.I'll get you some juice, all right?Be right back.(sobs quietly)(sobbing)(sniffs)Holden, I've brought you an apple juice and an orange juice.Wasn't sure which one...Holden?Holden!(Jasper whimpers)What is wrong with you?I don't feel good.I need my mommy.Baby, I am your mommy.My other mommy.It's confirmed.Blood on your junkie wasn't his.So we're looking for a body now.You don't think we have enough bodies?Hey, how come I've never heard of a town where 20 kiddie murders and abductions supposedly took place?Are you talking about the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders?They changed the name of the town.Bad publicity.When?Hell, 60 years ago?Eighty-five.85... years...The crimes took place in the '20s?Does this have something to do with our Bible-thumper?I don't know.Hahn: John?John, you okay?♪Countess: You must have a lot of questions.I have answers.It must have been a shock for you to see your boy.I imagined you'd lost hope long ago.I never gave up.No, you didn't.Your devotion moved me.I could feel your longing.Holden felt it, too.That's why he came to you.You stole my son.I saved him.Like I save all my children.From what?Neglect.I could see where they were headed.A tragic, wasted life.I opened my heart and the children came to me willingly.I never neglected my son.Can you say the same about your husband?Here you go.(phone buzzing)Yeah.Yeah, I'll meet you at the station later.John: Holden!(carnival music playing)Holden?!Holden!I brought them here to keep them safe.The world can be such a dangerous place.I've had enough of your bullshit.What did you do to my son?You're a doctor.I'm going to put it to you in a way that you can understand.Holden has contracted an ancient virus.A blood disorder.The effect of the disease is health, vitality and everlasting life.Whatever you did to him... change him back.Is this why you came up here?Change him back or I'll kill you.There is no going back.No.I'm his mother.We'll find a cure.There is no cure.The only way you can truly be with Holden is to join him.Alex, I'm offering you eternity with your great lost love.What I wouldn't trade for a chance at that.And what are you asking me to trade for it?What's the price I have to pay to be like you?Your undying loyalty.You'll be working for me.Here.Take this. It will calm your nerves.You're insane.You're going down.I'm getting the police.(screams)(whimpers)Let her go.She said she's gonna go to the cops.She won't.She would never risk losing her one true love.Wait, you're banging her, too?♪What'll it be, soldier?Ginger ale?Shirley Temple?My soon to be ex-wife says I was never an alcoholic.According to her, I'm just a control freak.I'll have a double martini.That's my boy.Control... is an illusion.John: Tonight I surrender to the illusion.(cocktail shaker rattles)(rock music playing)Woman: Hey, sailor.Didn't see you come in.I will stand on my head in a skirt for a ciggy and a beer.No need for acrobatics.Drinks are on me tonight.Liz: Now, Aileen, you be nice to Mr. Lowe.This is, what, your tenth year with us at the hotel?Lucky 13th!Liz: Ooh!Since 2002.Do I know you?I don't know.You ever picked up a hooker along I-95 in Florida?No, I think I'd remember that.John... is a police officer... and a special guest of the hotel.Cop.A cop.(laughs)Man! Man.(bottle clunks on bar)Man, are you lucky that I haven't had a beer in over a year, or there is no way in hell I would let you buy me one.They call me a serial killer?Greatest serial killer of all time is the cops.I know who you are.That is an outstanding costume.Holy sh1t, you look just like her.Her who?Aileen Wuornos.Just saw a documentary about her. She killed seven men. Shot them in cold blood.(cap pops off bottle)(sighs)Sometimes even I think that's true.I wasn't more than four or five when the world started taking from me.You know what you do when all you know is people taking?You start to give, give it away before they can take it from you.Give it all away for free, and that way, you can pretend that it doesn't hurt.Those seven men?We had a deal.We had a deal.Then they got greedy, started taking things didn't belong to 'em.Here's how it is, Detective: you try and take anything from Aileen Wuornos and I swear to Jesus H. Christ I will take everything from you.This is what I say to you, Aileen: That's bullshit.Yeah?Yeah.Most of those men didn't have a history or record of violence or assault.I don't know, I don't know their, I don't know their history.I only know who they were on that day.I only knew them on that one day, and on that one day, they were who they were.Haven't you ever had a day like that, huh?Yeah.Where-where all you were, all you ever had been your whole life don't mean nothing to you anymore?And all of a sudden... you're just a different person, huh?Yeah.Yeah?Today.When was the last time you got laid, huh?When was the last time a chick really... really turned you inside out?You don't know screwing until you spend an hour alone with a batshit crazy hooker.I got a room.Where I can roll.Darling John, you're too drunk to see how ugly that woman is.I'm too drunk to care.(laughs)(chuckles)You asshole.Goddamn cops.You can't trust any of them.Stop taking from me!I'm tied to a chair!Well, I ain't no liar.Ten women this sh1t country put to death, Ten.And I was number ten.Stop it! You're insane!You're not Aileen Wuornos!Yeah?Look at me.Look at my eyes.Look at 'em.This look like a Halloween costume to you?(snickers)Welcome to Devil's Night at the Hotel Cortez, John.Ain't you...(groans)Yeah, you like that?(screams)Die, you pussy boy!Asshole!Get... get back here!Bite your damn dick off!Bring it on, baby!Let's see who you really are.(spits)(elevator dings)Can I help you?Excuse me.Is there a problem?Yeah, there's a problem.That skank up in my room tried to kill me.Skank? You'll have to be more specific.You know, that nut job up at the bar pretending to be Aileen Wuornos.She's leaving here in cuffs.Yeah, I wouldn't bother with that call you're trying to make.Even if you got through, dollars to doughnuts, you won't find anyone in your room.Mr. March is very protective of his invited guests.Mr. March?James Patrick March?The very same.His annual Devil's Night soiree is the event of the season.What the hell is Devil's Night?Oh, sweetie.Devil's Night is the real holiday around here.Halloween, that's plastic pumpkins and paper costumes, but Devil's Night... is when the real ghouls come out to play.A night of mischievous criminal behavior, which is why every year at this time, Mr. March holds his annual dinner event.The guest list is tres exclusive.(gasps)Well, that's unusual.Now, how did I miss this?Lucky you.You've been invited.♪

(clicks tongue)(Aileen laughs)Aileen: No.All right.Zodiac, they never caught you but I assume you'd be dead by now.Dickheads like you don't just retire from being assholes.Gacy, you were killed by lethal injection over 25 years ago.Dahmer, you were murdered in prison.Deservedly.Aileen Wuornos, put to death in 2002 in Florida.And I know you, 'cause you're from my hometown.Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker.You just died of cancer in your cell a few years back.What is this?Some kind of Halloween trick?What, are you actors?I invited you here tonight to help you, John.I've watched you, and it makes me sad.Because greatness is about vision.And you have made yourself blind to everything but what your eyes can see.You need to listen to this dude, John.He... is the master.I mean, he taught us all.He's a genius, like Galileo or Peter Frampton.Gacy: That's why we come here every Devil's Night.It's, uh, like a tradition.It's a real honor to be invited.Only the ones of us who really took the master's advice gets an invite.Do you know why it took so long for the little piggies to catch me?Because one night I stumbled into this place, and I spent a few nights, and the master, he came into my room, and he beat the crap out of me, eh?And he told me that if I wanted to be a volume operation that I needed to be indiscriminate-- kill anyone.Your pattern needs to be no pattern.Guess I was out sick that day. (laughs)It's not funny, Gacy!We are the Mount Rushmore of murder.We have reputations, codes of conduct.I've told you how many times?Leave no evidence.Gacy: I covered 'em all with lye.It's not my fault that the cop who used my bathroom was very familiar with the smell of rotting bodies.I told them-- it was my Lhasa apso who piddled on the kitchen floor, but they didn't believe me.Murder is one part perspiration, ten parts preparation.Mmm.I built this hotel for the sole purpose of hiding the evidence.All of my chutes and ladders, have you seen them yet, John?Miracles of modern engineering.Mr. Gacy here came to the Hotel Cortez when he was just a young man.18 or 19.I was living in Vegas, and I wanted to see the Pacific, so I got in the old Buick and drove out for the weekend and stayed here-- six bucks a night.I showed him my secrets, he was good, very good.But imagine what he could have accomplished had he really listened to me.33 bodies.He could have had 333.Gacy: Huh? That's my trick.The handcuffs.Once I have them cuffed, it's pretty much all over.March: No need to worry, John.It's the absinthe, dear boy.When I was 19, trucker picked me up hitchhiking.And that was before I knew how to take care of myself.That dick cheese drove me all the way to L.A.Bought me In-N-Out.Tossed me to the curb.It wasn't until I stumbled into this place... and met the master that I knew, I knew I was really worth something.It's the first man that ever treated me with respect.Jeffrey?You're even more quiet than usual tonight.I'm just hungry.Ah, Ms. Evers.It's always a delight.Ladies first.Please.I don't eat salad.Aileen: Jeffrey likes dark meat!(laughter)Miss Evers, bring out the amuse-bouche now, would you?♪Ah.♪ Wouldn't turn around and break it ♪Thank you, John.♪ And anyone who's ever played a part ♪
