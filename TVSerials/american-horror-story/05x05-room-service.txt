Did it ever occur to you that maybe they might...Yeah, of course it occurred to me!That's not what this is.Okay, so what is it?It's, uh...(mumbles)Must be some kind of... copycat blood cult.I don't know, you call it what you want to.It was people who are recreating or are continuing the crimes committed by notorious killers from the past.(man screams)March-- there was a guy.One guy called himself March, James Patrick March.You just check out the history of the hotel.That's the name of the guy who built it.And you had dinner with him.I was in a room with a guy who claimed to be him, a guy who I think is responsible for the five dead bodies on the wall in my office!You think he's The Ten Commandment Killer?I do.I do.Lieutenant, we need to get a-a warrant, cadaver dogs, forensics team.We need to rip those walls apart, down to the studs if you have to, 'cause the answers are in there!I'd stake my reputation on it.You're gonna have to ante up more than that because your reputation's sh1t.(sighs)Let's be honest, it has been for a while.What's that supposed to mean?It means I probably should never have signed off on that marginal psych evaluation you received five years ago after your breakdown.That was different.Our son had been taken.I was under a lot of stress.This job is stress, John.(sighs)I'm sorry.I'm gonna have to do what's right for the department.You're firing me.Your pension will be safe.Nothing is safe.Nothing.♪(bell dings)(clears throat)How can I help you?We're wondering if you had any special rates for, like, influencers.I beg your pardon?Uh, well, um, I used to shoot for Entrez-Vous Magazine, and I heard that Will Drake took over, and he's liked a shit-ton of my Instagram pics.We would like a room.And a discount.(chuckles) Look, I'm sure you can't get the full rate at this hour on Hallo-friggin'-ween.Oh, we are so over trick-or-treaters.Our-our neighborhood used to be kind of rad.But now it's just Strollerville.Everyone started pooping out kids.So many brats.The doorbell would not... stop... ringing.We just want to hide out and smoke out and not deal with a zillion randos.I hope this suits you.Wait.Hey, w-wait.No, we-we want to stay in one of the rooms that Will Drake has redone.Well, they're all more or less untouched.This is a hard no.

Ask away.Uh-huh.So, how does something like this happen?How does a married man from Topeka wind up as Liz Taylor in the Hotel Cortez?Her name was Tracy. She married me because she was 30 and needed to marry someone.(door closes)What are you watching?You have the weirdest taste in TV shows.Isn't Cosby on tonight?Thursdays.I married her because we were the same dress size.When I was home, I was like a man walking between the raindrops.No release from the constant burning.It's for your trip.This is a 707.I fly a 757 to Los Angeles.It has only two engines.Tracy: Don't you have to pack?But I had the road.I was a medical rep for Eli Lilly.It was a golden age for us.We used to schmooze doctors.Took them golfing, took them out for steaks, to strip clubs.Plenty of alcohol to numb myself.But the real release came when I was finally alone in my room.We're taking Schwartz and Siegel to the Palm at 8:30 and then to Crazy Girls.This time, we're all wearing rubbers so we don't stain our slacks.(laughter)Nothing like an L.A. lap dance.Yeah.You in, Nicky?Oh, no, thanks.I'm all about room service and a good night's sleep tonight.Don't watch too much p0rn.Yeah!(both laugh)♪ As we fall in love ♪
