Gentlemen, I want you to meet my daughters, Marie Louise Pauline, Marie Louise Jeanne, and from my first marriage, Marie Delphine Lopez.But everyone calls her Borquita.What they may lack in outer beauty, they more than make up for with their many talents.Borquita is a huge help to me with the domestics.While Jeanne excels in petit point.My youngest, Pauline, well, her major talent has yet to reveal itself.Perhaps my talent is in the boudoir, Mother dear.I guess we'll find out on your wedding night, mon petit.(chuckles)(insects chirring)(animals chittering)MAN:Mon cherie.When the blood dries, my skin is supposed to be tight as a drum.Just look at this wattle.(sniffs)This blood's not fresh.Borquita!S'ak pase'w la?Mon cherie, something happened during the dinner party.Stupid slut!I invite all the eligible bachelors just to meet you and you...(slapping)spread your filthy legs for the houseman!You might as well rut with the family dog!You can't control me, Mother.The hell I can't!The hell I can't.You know what we're going to say?We're going to say he took you by force.Like the savage he is.No, ma'am, I did no such thing.Yes, that's what happened. Miss Pauline came on to me.And I told her I belong to someone else.Keep that mongrel quiet.(man cries out)Haul him upstairs.MAN: No. No. No.(hinges creaking, door thuds)Bonsoir, my pets.Did y'all miss me?(muffled shouts)Hush up.Or I'll rip your lips open and stuff more sh1t in there.(chains rattling)Why?Why are you doing this to us?Because I can?Oh...Now we gonna have flies up here.(chains rattling)There.That should do it.Bastien.(people coughing, groaning)You want to rut like a beast... then we're going to treat you like one.(sobbing)Where's my pickaninny with the head?(Bastien whimpering frantically)Put it on him.(frantic whimpering continues)(frantic whimpering continues)Darling, you have outdone yourself.However did you think this up?My great literacy began with Greek mythology.I used to sit on Daddy's lap and he would read me those stories full of their vengeful Gods and wondrous miraculous creatures.But the Minotaur was always my favorite.Half-man, half-bull.And now...I have one of my very own.(low, guttural laugh)(frantic whimpering continues)(insect chirring)(keys jingling)Are you sure about this?Come on.My mom gets home at : .It just sucks being somebody's first.I don't want to hurt you.I'll be okay.You okay?Charlie?Charlie?Charlie, Charlie, what's wrong?(grunting)Charlie!Charlie?!GIRL: It's a cliche, but like all cliches, it's the truth.Your life can change overnight.Or in a moment.(sighs)The official word on Charlie's death was a brain aneurysm.But the doctors had never seen anything quite like it before.The blood... all that blood.It's not your fault, baby.It's ours.There's something I should have told you a long time ago.I prayed it would skip your generation.Your great-grandmother had the same genetic affliction.GIRL: So apparently I'm a witch.It runs in my family, but it doesn't show up in every generation,i]or in every girl.[/i]Like my cousin Amanda, she's just bulimic.We read about the Salem Witch Trials in, like, fifth grade.Guess I should have paid more attention.Hang her! Drown her! Burn her!CHIEF MAGISTRATE: Mercy Osbourne, you have been sentenced to death.May God have mercy on your wretched soul.GIRL: Those girls weren't even witches.The real witches were cunning and careful not to be caught.(angry shouting)In fact after that, they got the hell out of Dodge.(angry shouting)They fled.As far South as they could.(angry shouting)That's how eventually New Orleans became the new Salem.WOMAN: There's a school there.A boarding school for girls like you.You'll be safe.You're sending me away?WOMAN: I'm sorry, baby.We can't keep you here anymore.It's too dangerous.What's going on?Mom, what's going on? What is this?Mom! Mom... No, what is this?!Mom...(sobbing):Mom!We'll handle it from here.Can't I drive her to the station?She's our daughter now, Nora.You've done all you can.A long good-bye would only make things worse.By the way, these drapes.I'm just mad for tartan.(birds singing)(doorbell chimes)(metallic click, hinges creaking)(hinges creaking)Hello?(hinges creaking)Hello?Hello?(flames crackling)(screams)(running footsteps)(girl gasping)(screams)O dark father, we offer this flesh up to you, blood, life, and all.Get the hell off me!(panting)Jesus,Sabrina, relax.We're just messing with you.Holy sh1t. Are you...Madison Montgomery, movie star.sh1t. When's the last time you made a movie, girl?I'm Nan. Hi.Zoe.Queenie.So bored now.So, is this all of you?At the moment.Cordelia Foxx, headmistress.All right, girls, there's a van full of groceries in the driveway that needs unloading.I'll show Zoe to her room.Then we meet for Midday Gathering.Let's go.CORDELIA: Miss Robichaux's Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies was established as a premieregirls' finishing school in .During the Civil War, it was converted into a military hospital.Afterwards, it came under new management. Our management.In , Marianne Wharton,a prominent East Coast society matron,early suffragette,author of several popularchildren's books--and, as it happened, the reigning Supreme of that time-- purchased this facility, retaining the name as a cover,establishing a safe havenwhere young witches could gather to learn.In its heyday, the academy was hometo as many as girls.Over the years, those numbers dwindled.ZOE: Why?We're a dying breed, Zoe.Many of the families who knew they carried the bloodline made a choice not to reproduce.So, what's a Supreme?An average witch is born with a few natural gifts.But in each generation there is one woman who embodies countless gifts.Some say... all of them.She is the Supreme.Are you the Supreme?No.I'm like you.Just a witch.And a teacher. I'm here to help you identify your gifts and teach you how to control them.She means to suppress them.Not suppression.Control.She thinks it's still the s.No. Back then, our kind understood the dangers.Today, so many families know nothing of their ancestry.Too many girls aren't lucky enough to have found usor weren't identified in timefor us to have found them.Like that poor Cajun girl just outside Lafayette a few months back.Misty Day.She wasn't much older than any of you.And she had a gift, the power of resurgence.Misty could reach into that place between life and death and draw a soul backfrom the precipice, back to this side, back to life.It's dark magic!To some, this appeared to bethe God-touched power of resurrection.To cast you in to darkness and sin!To others, necromancy.To cast you into separation from God!So what happened to her?The same thing that's happened to women like us throughout the centuries.(pants)Let me go!Let me go!(sobs)(panting, coughing)(whimpering)(match struck)(panting)It's you that will end in flames.I swear it!(crying)(wailing)We are under siege, ladies.Our lives, our very existence is always at risk.Know this or face extinction.This is Allegra.She is the equivalent of a human female in her late s.Allegra suffers from acute bradycardia, her kidneys are failing, she's lost the abilityto swallow.Allegra, in short, is dying.Now, several hours after this video was taken, we injected Allegra with our Serum RM .We expanded on the University of Wisconsin studies on induced pluripotent stem cells.Meet Allegra today.I'll have what she's having.(chuckles)And you will.Sooner than you'd think.We should be ready for human trials in two years' time.This afternoon.(chuckles)Preferably in the next half hour.I have a dinner engagement.I'm sorry, but, uh... well, that's impossible.I hear you like to get... sauced at biochemistry conventions and brag about how you're gonnawin the Nobel Prize for the work you're doing here, research that has been entirely funded by my late husband's money.I have made you rich, soon to be famous.I want that medicine.I paid for it, and I want it.Now.You can't smoke in here.(exhales)Fiona... you are a very beautiful woman.But if you're just looking for something cosmetic, I can recommend a plastic surgeon.What I need... is an infusion of vitality.Of youth.I want that drug, David, and I want it now.Even if I wanted to give it to you, I couldn't.What we do here is not magic.I'm sorry.(Iron Butterfly's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" playing)(sniffing)REPORTER: Last night, communities across the county held candlelight vigils prayingfor Misty's safe return.However, sources close to the family have declined to comment on the fact that authorities now believethey have found the last known location of the missing girl.It is rumored that Misty Day may have been burned at the stake, though no official statementwas released.(knocking)You made me leave my daughters' violin recital early. You've been injecting me with yoursh1t for five days now and nothing...nothing has changed.How do I know you're not just shooting me up with some sugar water?I have risked my career giving you these drugs.They could kill you. I could go to jail.Double the dosage.Pull our funding.Give me more!We are organic matter.We are animals. We rot, we die!I will tender my resignation in the morning.No!What is this?How are you doing this?(grunts)Get away from... get away from me!(grunts)(groaning)(panting)No.Please.My children.Don't be such a baby.(moaning)(grunting)(lighter clatters)Hey, Jeeves. Can I get some iceberg lettuce with a side of blue cheese?Girl, be nice to Spalding.Poor b*st*rd ain't got no tongue. Is that true, Jeeves?Did you use your tongue for something wicked?Or maybe you just suck at going down.Oh, come on, Jeeves.Show us your stub!Maybe we can put it to use!So, new girl......what are you in for?Her boyfriend.Nan, shut up before you getyour ass in trouble.Did you kill him?No. It was an accident.It was an accident, Zoe.And you will find love again.A strange and unexpected...love.Girl, are you deaf or just stupid?MADISON: Tell us about this accident.And don't spare all the gory details.So, why are you here?My agent staged an intervention.Ever since my drunk and disorderly, I get blamed for all kinds of sh1t that I didn't do.But you did it. You killed the man.I get it, bitch, you're clairvoyant.Do you want to know what happened?Hi, boys. So glad you all could come.Gee, is it hot in here?Cut, cut.You're still not hitting your mark.I'm using the space.That's a light.If you don't hit your mark, that light can't hit you.The light hit him just fine.All he said was "hit your mark."Why don't you just do the world a favor and take an acting class, you D-list, Botox bimbo.Ow!Stop it, you bitch!Stop what? I don't feel nothing.I'm a human voodoo doll.(screams)You like this?Stop!You're... you're gonna get in trouble.Queenie, stop!I'll do it.Come on.Let's take a walk.A walk?Fine. I'm not hungry anyway.(exhales)Like anyone believes that.Well, that was disturbing.Given the choices around here, it looks like you're my new best friend.(phone vibrates)Do you own any clothes that don't come from the Gap?Not really.Why?(sighs)You can borrow something of mine.Frat party tonight.Just got the tweet.
