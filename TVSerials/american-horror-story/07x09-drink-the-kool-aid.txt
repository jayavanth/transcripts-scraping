On March th , acting on an anonymous tip,police found the bodies of membersof the Heaven's Gate cult.They had committed suicide by ingesting a poisonous mixof pudding, apple sauce and phenobarbital.What only they knew--because only they had been blessedby their leader with his bomb of knowledge--was that they weren't killing themselves,they were just leaving the vehicles of their bodiesand graduating to the next level.A comet had returned,one with an orbital period of , years,and in its tail was a spacecraft.Once the members left their bodies,they could get a ticket to ride on the shipand leave this earthly shithole forever.Isn't that cool?Many of the lucky bastardshad themselves voluntarily castrated in Mexico.They had been taught by their leader, Marshall Applewhite,aka Do, to forgo- ...of human ways, - any earthly pleasures:- human behavior, - s*x, gourmet cheese,- human ignorance, - dogs, the Beatles.- human misinformation.- These were all distractionsthat would do nothing but keep them trapped in their- And that can't happen, - antiquated flesh vehicles.unless you leave the human world that you're in...and come and follow me.It makes total sense when you think about it.Time is short.Last chance.Is it any wonder that the federal government,led by Democratic President Bill Clinton,had to try to take down David Koresh?Koresh was blessed with the gift of prophecywhen he was a young man.God revealed himself to young David,told David that his ideasand sperm would have great power and influence.Zephaniah says, "He will not do iniquity.He will bring forth His..." He collected a loyal group of followers.He became the leader of the Branch Davidians.They understood that he was the chosen one,that his sermons were more than words--they were the secrets they neededto enter the Kingdom of Heaven.He dissolved all marriages amongst his followers.Men had to be celibate.He was the true savior,and it made sense for himto father all of the childrenand repopulate the planet.He had divine semen.Holy ejaculate.God's own DNA shot from his mighty prick.KORESH: Don't you understand?This is my family.I would never let you take my family from me.You come to my door, pointing guns at my wives and my kids,I will meet you at the door, any time.KAI: When the government came to arrest Koresh and his followersforlegally collecting gunsand ammo,some left the compound, but the true believers stayed behind.They refused to leave their father.And why should they?They had listened to his holy teachings.The Lord is my shepherd, and I shall not fear.They knew that there was greater gloryin crossing the threshold into death with their leader- than staying behind andbeing slaves in a lost-(yelps) and broken world.(gunshots) (gunshots in distance) men and womendied either by gunshot or in the fire.Sucks.(gunshot) (static) (helicopter blades whirring) But the Kanye of leaders was the great Jim Jones,the man who coined the phrase "drink the Kool-Aid."He founded the Peoples Temple.It was a beautiful rainbow.They saw no race or class or s*x.He moved his entire congregation,over a thousand people, to Guyana with the planof creating a utopia.But it all fell apart.He was betrayed by his own.They invited a congressman to inspect their private heaven.He didn't understand.He tried to destroy the perfect world Jones had created.So Jones had to have him killed.He had no choice.But once that seal was broken,there was no going back.He had to end it all.And of his loyal parishionerswere more than happy to follow him anywhere,even to the other side.If we can't live in peace, then let's die in peace.(cheering and applause) - How very much I've loved you.- MAN: Love you, too, Dad.Yeah!How very much I've tried to give you the good life.But, in spite of all my triumphs...It's in my opinion that you be kind to your children and be kind to your seniors and you take the potion like they used to take in ancient Greece and step over quietly, - because we are not committing suicide.-(choking sounds) It's a revolutionary act.- (crying, coughing) - You bet your life, - you bet your life.And to me, - (cheering and applause) death is not a fearful thing-- - it's the living that's fearful.- (coughing) Mother, please, can somebody show these children to the relaxation of stepping over to the next plane?All they're doing is taking a drink to go to sleep.That's all death is.It's sleep.Stop this crying and hysterics!- (gunshot) - Die with a degree of dignity.- (gunshot) - Don't die with tears and agony.Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, my children.God Almighty, God Almighty.- (coughing, shouting) - (sighs) These were great men.All of them.Do you understand why I'm telling you about them?You want us to see how you're like them?That's right, Pus Bucket.But I also want you to see that it's easy to get men to kill for you.Any asshole with enough money or a rank in the army can get men to do that.Real power is having people loyal enough to you that, if you ask them to, they will kill themselves.They will override their natural survival instinct in service of your needs and will.Wait, are we a cult?I thought we were a political movement.All politics is a personality cult now, Heart Attack.(sighs) You don't have to raise your hand, Tripod.(chuckling) I know we're not supposed to jerk our meat, but...are you gonna make us cut off our balls like that Hale-Bopp guy?Would you, if I asked you to?I totally would!f*ck it.(chuckles) Whatever you f*cking want, Kai.I don't want that, Speedwagon.Even if he's not jizzing, a man needs his balls to produce testosterone to make him strong and aggressive.But what if I asked you to make the ultimate sacrifice?Would you do that for me, Speedwagon?With a f*cking smile.How 'bout the rest of you?Sandstorm?Gutterball?- Yes.- Yes.(exhales) Thank you all for your loyalty.'Cause things are about to change.We are expanding, brothers.Our ambitious, nation-saving agenda is headed to the next level, and it's gonna take even more courage and focus and, most of all, loyalty to navigate these stormy waters ahead.GUTTERBALL: What's gonna happen?You'll find out at the council meeting on Monday.Get some rest.(grunting)♪ ♪ ♪ ♪The left-wing propagandists at CNN and NBC have polluted our discourse with fake news.Pornography has desensitized our young men.We've lost a generation of moms to Candy Crush!This can't go unchecked.I don't doubt your good intentions, Councilman, but banning our citizens from accessing a list of Web sites that you personally deem offensive-- what you're proposing is censorship.It's not censorship-- it's regulation.It's about protecting the people from cultural decay.And connecting every computer in town to a private network.- The cost alone...- Why don't we ask your colleagues about their feelings on this matter, Perry?Councilman Moyer?You've been silent all day.I think it's a fantastic idea, sir.KAI: Good.All in favor of the Kai Anderson Internet Freedom and Integrity Act?The motion passes.(cheering) Finally, finally, I'd like to make a statement.Tonight, I'm announcing to you, my loyal constituents, that I intend to run for United States Senate in .We need fresh representation in Washington, and I believe I am the man for the job.(cheering) - (whooping) - Yeah!Councilman.Councilman, the senator up for reelection is a popular incumbent who's served for three terms.Anything can happen, Perry.SPEEDWAGON: That was amazing, Divine Ruler.- Thank you.Where are our women?- I don't know.We told them about the meeting.They should be here.I'm not feeling love from them, Speedwagon.Or loyalty.ALLY: I need to know why.I need to know.I want a f*cking explanation.Why did you join a cult?Why did you destroy our family?- Why?!- (gasps) You were...you were a mess, and The Butchery was ten times more work than we thought it would be for half the reward.I just...I-I felt...I felt like I was out of control, like there was no boundary or structure to contain me or my feelings, and...I wanted someone to come in and say, "Do this.Go there."Believe in this.Care about that." A daddy?- (sighs) - I guess, yeah.It felt so good to take my hands off the wheel.And I...am sorry, but I hated you.Or...I was so...I was so angry at you that I thought I hated you.And in my head, I told myself, if the price that I have to pay f-for this feeling of relief was...destroying you, then-then why not?People died, Ivy.Because of you.I know.I know.I know.Oh, God.I don't know how I could have been so stupid and so weak.I don't know.I'm so sorry, Ally.And now I see him for what he is.He's a demagogue and a manipulator and...everything he touches dies.But I was leaving.I was done.I was on my way out.So you have to explain to me, why did you become a part of this insanity?What choice did you give me?You wouldn't talk to me.You wouldn't let me see our son.I knew you would never leave unless I got you out.You came back for me?I came back for Oz.And for our family.I'm not saying if we get out of this that we're gonna be together.But if we can escape, I am not leaving Oz's mother behind.(door latch clicks) Mom?Hey.It's okay, buddy.She...Hey, Ozymandius.Can you give your mama a hug?I'm sure you're feeling confused.You've probably heard some strange things about me from your mom, and...maybe others.But I am never going to leave you ever again.And it's going to take some time, but I promise it will feel easy and normal before you know it.Okay?Okay.Would you just go upstairs for a minute so the grownups can talk?And, um...I got you something.- But that has a clown on it.- Of course it does.Twisty's the title character.Who else are they gonna put on the cover?Come on.I'll be up in a minute.Go read it.Mama?Yeah?I missed you.I missed you, too, sweetheart.Hey.You look good.I'm really sorry.For what?f*cking my wife...trying to drive me crazy...or trying to kill me?WINTER: Everything.I was an idiot.We all were.The election made me lose my mind.I didn't believe in anything anymore, except that my brother loved me and would take care of me no matter what.The world decided to take a huge sh1t on my head, so I said f*ck the world.All I need is my family.But then he killed our brother.Vince was an asshole, but he was one of us.Kai doesn't care about me.He doesn't care about anyone.We have to run away.It's the only way.I found this on wikiHow."How to escape from a cult." They lay out steps, it's all in there.We have to pack lightly and get out as quickly as we can.- And go where?- Anywhere.We just have to go now.If Kai finds out we're even thinking about this, we'll be killed or put in the hole like Beverly.Okay, let's go.But no packing.- I'll get Oz.- Iwill f*cking get Oz.(pounding on door) PUS BUCKET: Open up!I know you're in there!(pounding continues) (pounding louder) Emergency meeting at Divine Ruler's.What are you bitches up to in here?Just a little girl time.Talking cookie recipes and boys.f*ck you, liar.Let's go.And bring the kid.Kai said he could watch cartoons upstairs while we meet.Let's go!- What are they doing up there?Maybe Kai...-Not now.Let's stop talking in this house.(door opens) BEVERLY: You lying bitch!I'm gonna kill you!(yells) - Hey!- Get the f*ck off!- Hey!- Get off of me!Get her off!Get off of her!- Come on!- (all shouting) Stop this nonsense.
