It was better than s*x. He made me feel special, like we were the only two people in the world. I'd been afraid for so long. I'd built up a wall of Housewives and Drag Races to anesthetize myself from all the sh1t in the world. But I hated feeling helpless. Hated myself for being so weak, trapped by feminist expectations.
