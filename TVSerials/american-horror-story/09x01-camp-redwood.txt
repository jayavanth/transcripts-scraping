I can show you all a tour of the camp.We have canoes and rowboats.All children must have a buddy to go into the water.The lake is allegedly bottomless, and drowning is the number one cause of death for U.S. campers.What's second?♪♪And this is Chef Bertie, a Camp Redwood veteran.Dibs.You wouldn't know what to do with it if you got it, handsome.(RAY CHUCKLES)Put those scrawny arms to work and help a lady fill her pantry.All of you, grab a crate.This heat is a killer.MARGARET: Chef Bertie worked here when I was a counselor.We are so blessed to have her with us.I have many good memories of this place.It's magic up here in the fresh air.I'm sorry that one bad apple ruined it for everyone.The minute I heard Margaret was reopening this place, I was first to volunteer.No. No, no, no, this... all this goes up to the mess hall.MARGARET: Girls shower in the a.m., boys in the p.m.Same goes for counselors, too.This is the girls' cabin.And this is the boys' cabin.Girls are red.
