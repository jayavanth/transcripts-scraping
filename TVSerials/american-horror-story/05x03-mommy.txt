(elevator bell dings)(jazz music playing in distance)♪ ♪I don't know if you can hear me.I got to admit, you freaked me out before.I didn't understand you, but... I get it now.Come on, man, talk to me.I know everything about you.I'm a fan.Your name is James Patrick March.You were born October 30, 1895.You're a Scorpio, which explains a lot.You're the greatest serial killer who's ever lived.How do you know all this?I Googled you.That sounds obscene.You were right, man.Killing is awesome.High five!Good. You've found your calling.Then you can appreciate what I've built here.Secret rooms, hinged walls, acid pits, asphyxiation chambers.Are you familiar with my Black Closet?(whimpering)(screaming)Yes.There are places in my murder palace that have sat in cold neglect for far too long.You can put them to good use, old boy.I'm listening.Good.Now...Claudia: My God, look at this.Will: The whole floor needs to be torn out.This space is perfect for my atelier.It's gonna be sensational.And wait until you see this room.What are you doing here?Visiting a friend.I was told that nobody lives on this floor.You're a squatter.Tristan, you clean up pretty well.I barely recognized you.Thank you, Claudia.What happened to your cut?Get your paws off.I'm not here to be a deposit in your spank bank.(Lachlan laughs)Owned, Dad.Get out.I'll call the cops if I see you in my hotel again.Claudia: Models.Ms. Evers: Tear this floor out?Where will I launder the linens?He can't be allowed to touch a single room.Don't worry, dude.I got this.Alex: It's hard to believe now, but raising kids was never a part of my hopes and dreams.My friends with babies only made me more resistant.Their lives seemed kind of dreary, to be honest.I wanted to save kids, other people's kids.If I'm honest?Being the best pediatrician possible was my only real dream.Okay.We're going to get you to the hospital and put you on a big fat IV of antibiotics.Okay?We just need his slippers and his coat.Wait, wait, wait, hospital?This kind of pneumonia, the one we associate with, uh, the measles, is something we like to treat, uh, aggressively.I don't understand why you didn't you call me the second his fever went over a 103.(knocking on door) I... I guess I felt ashamed after our last conversation.You made me feel pretty terrible.Please just tell me he's gonna be all right.I hope so. Upstairs.(machines beeping rhythmically)Alex: By the way, I'm not unaware of the obvious cliché here--I wanted to save kids because I felt I needed saving.But in my case the cliché is dead on.Suffice it to say, mine was not a happy childhood.(coin clatter in slot)(indistinct P.A. announcement)(whirring, liquid pouring)Then Holden showed up.It was a tectonic shift where everything I thought I knew about myself got rearranged.It was like I finally fell in love for real.All the cracks and missing pieces came together.I felt whole.I'd found my soul mate.I couldn't stop smelling his head.It made me feel drowsy and giddy, like we were in the middle of a lavender field in the south of France.The smell was real.He truly smelled like fresh lavender.It was and always will be my drug of choice.I even wondered if I truly loved John, because my feelings for him were never as powerful as my feelings for Holden.And I've always felt guilty because I never quite bonded like that with Scarlett when she was a baby.It was a special kind of love.Maybe a once in a lifetime thing.And then he disappeared.John (screaming): Holden!Holden?Holden!Holden!♪ ♪At first, every time you hear the phone, you think they've found him.(phone buzzing)Your heart pounds.Hello?Then after a month or so, (phone buzzing) the phone is just the phone.You do whatever you need to do to soldier on, because, you tell yourself, time is on your side.(water running)And then a year has gone by, and you understand that the next year will not be much different.This feeling will never go away...(whining)...'cause there is no getting over it, there is no getting to the other side.I do carry on.Mostly for Scarlett.But there are many days when I don't really know why.Some days are bearable.Today is very hard.Woman: Alex?You with us?We haven't heard a lot from you, Alex.I don't know what to say.I'm afraid the truth about how I'm feeling wouldn't be very helpful.This is the right place for you to speak your truth.And the right time.Honestly, I'm angry.I mean, I don't understand, Scarlett.It's like you're trying to hurt me.Us.Woman: I don't have the sense that Scarlett holds any ill will.Her stories strike me as being more about wanting to alleviate your pain, wanting the family whole again.You're both wrong.It's not about my mother or the family.It's what happened.Scarlett, tell us the story exactly how you remember it.Tell us everything.Well, there's a room where they all play Nintendo and there are these big glass things full of jelly beans.That sounds like a fun place.And he sleeps in the bottom of a glass coffin in the bottom of an empty swimming pool.That's when I first saw him.He was just waking up.And when you first saw him... and what did he say exactly?Does he talk about us?No, he was different.He didn't have normal feelings.And he smelled like lavender.You know, like those candles we have at home.(door opens)Claudia: Yes, dear.Yes, the change of scenery was good for Will.He was getting too stale in New York.Yes, Jess.I'm losing you.Can you hear me?Claudia, Claudia...Yes.We need to get Mario Testino out here to do a shoot.Did you hear that? Jess?Oh, darn.(water dripping)(indistinct whispering)(bubbling)(gasps)(muffled screaming)No!(grunting)No! No!Help me! No!(both grunting)(screaming)(screaming echoes, fades)(distant siren wailing)I got the guys checking on Islamic terrorist groups active in the area.You know, this could be another Charlie Hebdo thing.This is a gossip site.He stopped their tongues from wagging.Thou shalt not bear false witness.These people trafficked in lies.They broke the commandment.John: Have ballistics run a check on the casings at the scene with casings from previous murders.Yeah, all of them.Gotcha.There may be a previous commandment murder that we missed. We'll cross-reference.I'm not sure, but I think...(grunts)(gasping): Help me.Help me.(gasping sharply)Boo!(laughs)How the hell did you get in here?I picked the lock.When I was first starting out modeling, I made extra scratch as a thief.I'm not the waiting tables type.I did six months for breaking and entering.Did you know that?Look, I'm sorry about the show.I'm clean now, I swear.You and I used to get along great when I was clean.You thought I was hilarious.Every beautiful young thing is hilarious.And then you get old and you don't understand why everyone isn't still laughing at your jokes.How did they fix that scar?I'll show you mine if you show me yours.(both chuckling)What are those?They're the original plans for the hotel.Well, they're the ones that are registered with the city, but they're not the plans for this hotel.How do you know?Well, for one thing, there's that hallway on three with no doors that goes nowhere.And, uh, according to these plans, there's rooms off of them and access to the stairwell.So I think somebody submitted these plans to get through inspection, but then just built how they wanted to.Man, you smell good.You know that's actually the worst part about being in jail?It's not the food or being locked up like a dog.It's the smell.Everyone smells like sh1t.Doesn't stop you from doing stuff, though, you know?A man has needs, right?What is happening?Hmm? What are you doing?(moaning)(moaning)Stay.Stay...Another time.What...(stammers)Looking at an O.D. here?You'd think so, but everything's telling me withdrawals.I don't think this man's had a needle in him in a few days.At least.The blood? Not his.(gasps)Let's get him sedated.No! Please! I'm sorry!I didn't mean it! Wait! Wait! Wait!Please. I'm sorry.Wait, why are you sorry?Detective. I didn't mean to kill her.Wait, wait, who-who did you kill?I thought it was the other one.The junkie whore.Sally? Sally?She did this to me.She lied to me.She said that I'd be free.Okay, got to go.Got to go!(grunting)We're losing him.(rapid beeping)(flat line drones)(elevator bell dings)Sally: I hear she checked out.Who did?That shit-don't-stink fashion editor.Guess this place wasn't up to her standards.Not everyone can appreciate it here.All this lovely darkness.You know what I mean.No.I really don't.Why don't you tell me about your friend?Which one?The one at St. Vincent's.Junkie, covered in blood, not his.Oh, well, junkies.You can't believe a word they say.Who was he?(laughs)How the hell should I know?Why are you wasting your time on junkies?We only hurt ourselves.It's not like breaking one of the Ten Commandments.What did you say?What?Didn't you go to Sunday school?How about "Thou shalt not kill"?Hmm.Well, that commandment is always translated wrong.It should be "Thou shalt not commit murder."Killing can be a righteous act.(gasps)You've been in my room.No.(whispers): But if that's an invitation...How about this for an invitation?You're under arrest.Goody.(elevator bell dings)I know you sent me that text.I don't know how deeply you're involved, or if you're working with someone, or maybe just starved for attention.I am starving.You're starving, too.I can taste it on you.(unzips)Oh!Come on, Detective, show me right from wrong.I wanna help you.I wish you could.You'll see.You and I... we're meant to be.(elevator bell dings)Hey, Dono.I've been waiting for you.Look, you need any, uh, help packing?I, um, I printed out some Craigslist ads for apartments for us.Some nice two-bedrooms.And this one... this is...Get this, this is the building in Santa Monica where they captured Whitey Bulger.Just look at it-- it's glamorous, right?I will live with the addicts in shitter's alley in a box in MacArthur Park, covered in the piss and sh1t of this horror of a city before I even consider living under the same roof as you again.You're a drama queen.Baby, this is our chance.This is what we've been waiting for.Listen...Don't touch me.She never loved you.She was just using you.I knew that cold snake would get bored.Not because of you.You know, because that's just how snakes are.(elevator bell dings)(scoffs)You really have no idea how much I hate you, do you?And I get that you never wanted to take any authentic interest in me or my needs, but I have worked so hard over the past few years to get you to notice how much I despise you.Now, you hold on a minute.I gave my life to you.You have no clue how hard it was for me to raise you and the sacrifices that I made.Name one, one that didn't serve your perverted view of yourself.Your father.(elevator buzzes)You think it was an easy choice, kicking him out?Becoming a single mother at that time?Nobody did that, but I did, because he was nowhere near man enough to raise you.My father was the best thing in my life.I once hid out in the trunk of his Buick and he made it all the way to Bakersfield before he noticed and took me back home.(chuckles)Imagine that.He didn't even know his own son was in the trunk of his car.The guy was an asshole; he was a moron.Do you know, when you kicked him out, he sat me down and asked me to promise that when I was old enough I would run away?(scoffs)I had a plan.Oh, she had a plan.I went to an AA meeting once, and after I stood up and shared about you, people came up to me, hardcore addicts, and they were like, "Wow, man, no wonder you use."Every choice you made was a disaster.Dad... that insane vegetarian cult.The "Breatharaians" were cutting-edge.They were using food as medicine.I had so much fiber in my diet, I sh1t my pants at school.Fine, you make a list of all the ways I have failed you.And you know what I say to your list?sh1t on it.Because my list beats yours.Item one, I gave you life.Item two, I saved your life.I wanted to die!Coke, crack, heroin-- none of them could do it, so I decided death was my only way away from you.I chose it.You hated me like that?And you let me stay here looking after you?
