When the lid closed down on him, I felt like I was finally free.You fixed me, Doctor.I remember, when you first came in here, you couldn't even look at a picture of a coffin.And look how far you've come.You put in the work.The many tough hours of systematic desensitization, building from that image to the cemetery, coffins under your feet, and then finally stepping into that mortuary and facing the real source of your fear: your father.I'm so proud of you.(Rosie chuckles)(sighs)Whew.(sighs)I've got a surprise for you.What?Be right back.(sighs)(muffled grunting in distance)(muffled clattering)Mark?(screaming)No, don't...don't you touch her!- Mark!(screaming)- Honey, it'll be okay!- No!- No!Mark!Mark!What are you doing?!No, don't!- No!No!- Just let her go!- Let her go!- No!- Let her go!- No!No!No!(grunting, screaming)Let me go!No!No!No!(screaming)(power tool whirring)No!No!No!(screaming)(power tool whirring)(both screaming)♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪(sirens wailing, indistinct police radio chatter)(crying)(floorboard creaks)(sniffles)I'm in so much trouble, aren't I?Actually, no.We have a stand-your-ground law here in Michigan.You saw a dark figure coming into your house, you felt threatened.You have every right to defend yourself.(footsteps approaching)Finally got Ozzie to sleep.Is he okay?He must be so traumatized.I killed a man in front of his eyes.In self-defense.A-Absolutely.It was, it was pitch black.You didn't know who he was.The power grid is still down.W-We may be under attack by ISIS, you know...And the clowns.They were all over the house, terrorizing us.- Ozzie will tell you that.- Listen, Mr. Morales was already a person of interest.That's why we liked him for the murder at your restaurant.So it's no surprise to me that that kind of man would be a threat to a woman alone in the house at night with a young boy.Now, does that make sense?(loud electrical thump)(gasps)Oh, God, I'm sorry.I'm really sorry.(sighs)Look, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about, but I have to take this gun in case the D.A. decides to press charges.It's not your fault.It is not your fault, babe.I keep seeing Oz's face.He was standing right behind me.He saw everything.(sniffles)Even with all the counseling in the world, how is he ever gonna get over this?I think what we hope for is he finds a way to live with it.My question is: Can you?God, I'm so sorry.- I'm so stupid.- No, no.Stop it.It...I shouldn't have sent him over there in the middle of a blackout.I should have come home to you myself, and...(crowd chanting)CROWD: No justice, no peace!No justice, no peace!sh1t.Get down.Bob, I'm outside local eatery The Butchery on Main, where just a week ago one employee was found murdered.Activists gathered earlier today to protest the death of a second man, unarmed restaurant worker and father of three, Pedro Morales, who was gunned down Wednesday night by his employer, restaurant co-owner Allyson Mayfair-Richards.This latest scandal comes at a time of increasing tension in this normally peaceful community, beginning with the shocking murder-suicide of Councilman Chang and his wife.
