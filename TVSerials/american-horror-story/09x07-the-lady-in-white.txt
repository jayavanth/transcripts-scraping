I. and Ghostbuster wannabe from across the globe.And one of them's bound to figure out how to beat what's got us kept here; this f*cking curse.Don't you understand?You're away from the horrors of the world.Not really.You think we're alone in these woods?We're not alone.There's someone else.A woman.She wears a white nightgown, and she's constantly terrorizing us.No one knows who she is or why she hates us so much.I do.She's my mother.1970 wasn't the first massacre.There was another one 20 years before.If anything, that's when this blood curse began.When it first opened, this place went by a different name.- Camp Golden Star.- A little flower blooming in the wake of a war that took 400,000 American souls, including my old man.Luckily, the new camp was hiring.The work was hard and the pay was sh1t, but free childcare was a benefit a widowed mother couldn't turn down.She hated it.She was always so angry.When I looked in her eyes, I didn't see love.Only hate.And then Bobby died.I wanted to go home, but my mother, she wouldn't leave.I couldn't understand why.Until that night.Mom?Mom?It had to be done, Benji.They needed to pay for what happened to Bobby.It's okay, honey.Come to Mommy.You never listen, do you?He was your baby brother.You were supposed to take care of him.No.Oh, I'm gonna get you.Benjamin Benji!Come here!Benji!I'm sorry.Camp Golden Star was shut down.But ten years later, Camp Redwood opened.They may have changed the name, but they couldn't erase the evil.Her blood had poured into this ground, with her pain and her rage.Maybe that's why you're all still stuck here.It's definitely why she keeps coming after you.She hates counselors.The only person she ever loved was my brother.Do you know where my mother is now?Xavier will take you.Why me?Send Chet.I'm never going back to that place.Fine.I'll take you.I'm not going any closer.I've outrun her once before.I don't want to find out what happens if she catches up.Hello, Benji.Look at you.All grown up.Tall as your father.Oh.It's okay, honey.Come to Mommy.You've been here this whole time?Poor Benji.I can see the wheels turning in your head.And Bobby's here, too?Don't say his name!I miss your brother so much.Every day, I-I search for him.Sometimes, I can hear him, scared, but I I never find him.So I'm stuck here, tortured, in this place, like the goddess whose child was swallowed up into the ground.I've tried to destroy myself.Always I'm reborn to this cursed place.And then, one day I felt something.A vibration, something primal.My baby.But it wasn't him.It was you.I saw that look in your eyes.Like you wanted to stop time.A mother knows.You were happy.Pathetic, really, the way you mooned over that girl.What are you saying?What did you do?You should have known.That girl was already wrong in the head.I just needed to give her a little push.No.No.Why are you telling me this?Why are you appearing to me now after all this time?Because I don't like you.But now, finally, it's time.I want you to know it was me.I took the one thing you cared about and I used it to destroy you.Why do you hate me so much?Because the wrong son died that day!It should have been you!I know that.Do you have any idea the guilt I've felt, what it's done to me?Of course I do.It's turned you into a monster.You saw that?I saw everything.I saw you kill them all.But one was reborn.Ramirez.He killed my wife, the mother of my child.Your child?Yes, a son.I have a son.He's the only thing that matters to me now.As long as Ramirez is out there, my son will never be safe.I need to end this.This will never end.Because I will spend every moment from now to eternity making sure you burn in excruciating agony.Suffering as I do.It's what you deserve.I know you, Benji.I know you better than you know yourself.From the moment you were born, I knew you were a parasite, sucking me dry.A poison that taints and rots everything you touch.And so, I pity your son.I do.Having you as a father, he's better off dead.Your cruel device Your blood Like ice One look could kill I never thought I'd say this, but my mom was right.Never talk to strangers.I want to love you, but I better not touch - Don't touch - I want to hold you But my senses tell me to stop I want to kiss you But I want it too much Jesus.What the hell happened here?Venomous poison I don't want to break these chains.Karma's a bitch, girls.Rise and shine, little one.You were so close.A few more exits, and you would have made it to the festival.Where's Donna?What did you do to her?She's fine.See for yourself.No.No.No.You have two choices before you.Either you put it in drive, hit the gas, and live to see the great Billy Idol in concert, or I could shoot you in the face and drag her myself.Concrete is so unforgiving.These old roads are like cheese graters.Rip your clothes clean off at 40 miles an hour.At 50, human skin sloughs off like wet paper.Bones are ground into nubs as you try to hold your face up.But one little bump and you're bouncing.That's when pieces of you start falling off.How many people have you killed?Five so far.But I hope to catch up to Ramirez by Christmas.He had 13.One day I hope to surpass Bundy himself.So, I die, or I drag my friend to her death.Is that about right?That's the ticket.You know what?f*ck her.She should never have given you a ride in the first place.I'm starting to like you.What are you waiting for?Do it!Donna, wait!Hell no!I'm choking this m*therf*cker out.You don't want to do that, trust me.Can't just let him get away with it.Who said anything about that?Well, I didn't think it was possible, but it looks worse than I even imagined.What have you been doing?You announced the festival so quickly, we barely had time to do anything.We haven't locked in a caterer, and do not even get me started - on hydration.- Just give 'em a slice of Wonder Bread and a Dixie Cup of water.You can't do that, Margaret.People are paying a thousand dollars a head.That's how I make a profit, asshole.And don't you contradict me.- Remember who you are.- I'm your husband.You're a glorified assistant with no discernable talent or purpose.I know.The boys' restroom is covered in pine needles.Why don't you take that pendulum you call a dick and sweep up the mess?At least it'll be good for something, hmm?What fresh hell is this?So, where do you want the talent?- Who are you?- Oh, that's Kajagoogoo, you idiot!Limahl, are you gonna play "Too Shy"?I love that song.Oh, that's the only song we're going to play.It's our biggest hit.It's the only song anyone wants to hear.Wait, just one song?What about "NeverEnding Story"?Oh, it's from my solo career.I wouldn't dream of playing it with the band.One song What are you doing?- I I'm gonna go sweep up.- Okay.Hmm.Montana.I-I thought you were dead.I am.I'm a I don't care what you are.I'd forgotten what I was missing until I saw you.I know what I was missing.sh1t.Your hitchhiking days are over.Asshole.What are you doing?This is as far as you go.Redwood's close enough.I can walk it the rest of the way.You've done more than enough.Wait.I'm coming with you.I need to see this through to the end.Who the hell are you?I'm your biggest fan.What, you want a an autograph or something?- We already have it.- We?When you sign a contract with the devil you better understand the fine print.Oh, sh1t.You're too shy, shy, hush-hush, eye to eye - Too shy, shy, hush-hush - Guys?I brought you some goodies.Hush-hush, eye to eye Too shy, shy Oh, God.Hush-hush, eye to eye Too shy, shy Hush-hush, eye to eye Too shy, shy, hush-hush, eye to eye Too shy, shy.You shouldn't be here.You don't deserve to sit in the place where he died.You've already taken so much from me.I won't allow you to take away my place to mourn him.You don't get a claim on missing him.I miss him all the time.I think about him every day.I even named my son after him.Bobby.He's He's gonna grow up to be headstrong, just like Bobby.You should go and be with your son.I can't.- I need to face Ramirez.- You're a fool.He's in league with forces you cannot match.I know.But what kind of man would I be if I didn't do everything I could to protect my son?You made a deal with the devil.And Ramirez is here to collect.If you die by his hand, he'll make sure you don't come back.But if you die by your own you'll come back forever.If you truly want to protect him you'll do what has to be done.Bobby?I know you're out there.If you can hear me I'm sorry.And I won't curse my son the way I cursed you.- Hey, man.Who're you with?- Satan.Right on.Next Wednesday Every horror movie has a final girl.Final girl?The one who survives it all and lives to tell the tale.- I'm gonna end you in this place.- Bring it on, keyman.They're dead Courtney.Kajagoogoo is dead!
