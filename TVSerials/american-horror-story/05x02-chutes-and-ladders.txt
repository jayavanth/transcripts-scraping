(laughs)Why?'Cause of the smack?Getting high used to be like how you imagine heaven.Pure light.The perfection of it all.Even in me.Then I got lost.Kept trying to climb higher.Get closer to that light.Like an endless ladder where all you do is get further and further away.There's a part of you that wants to get lost, am I right?Climb that ladder.Tell me about your very last drunk.What kind of day was it?I like details.Started like most days.Multiple homicide in Glassell Park.Dad here spent the year in prison for second-degree assault.We figure he couldn't take the pressure, so he poisons them all, and blows his brains out.(indistinct radio transmission)(helicopter flying outside)Well, at least they died peacefully.What happens to a man makes him murder his own kids?He didn't.His power had been turned off, so he brings in a portable generator so his kids can stay warm.Must have ran out of gas.Comes back from his night shift finds his whole family dead from carbon monoxide poisoning.That's enough to make a man shoot himself.(gunshot)I had two kids at the time.Holden and Scarlett.I didn't make it back home for two days.Then the day I came home, I took the family to the beach.Some kind of desperate gesture to earn my wife's forgiveness.(laughs)It almost worked.Holden!
