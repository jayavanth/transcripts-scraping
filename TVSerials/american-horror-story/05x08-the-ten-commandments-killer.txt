Good bye, John.(amplified heartbeat)(tires screech)(horn honks)(tires screech)(people murmuring)♪Man: She ran out in the middle of the road.I never had a chance to stop.Woman: She's dead.John: It's time to make him stop.Wren: I really like you. I hate to see it end.(siren wailing in distance)(sniffles, sighs)(sighs)Where is he?Where's who?That monster you've all been protecting.The Ten Commandments Killer.He's here! Wren told me.Wren?That girl is full of lies.She's dead. She killed herself trying to protect him.Well... she was old enough to make her own choices.Where is he?I swear to God, asshole, you touch me one more time, I will cut your throat while you sleep!John.What the hell are you doing?The man I've been hunting is in this hotel.She knows it!You know it! I'm tired of being lied to!Fine.You want to know where the Ten Commandments Killer has been hiding?I'll take you there.You might want to take this with you.In case you find what you're looking for.Is this a joke?You're telling me he's in this room?I'm telling you there are answers on the other side of this door.This used to be where his office was.Did you know that?James Patrick March.Many years ago.James March is dead.In fact, this is where he died.February 25 at 2:25 in the morning.(alarm clock clicks, plays music)(whispers): We don't have to do this.We can turn around and walk out of here right now.Go to the bar, have a couple drinks.(gasps)Why did you bring me back here?!Behind the armoire.That's where you'll find what you're looking for.♪(door creaking)Jesus.How long has this been here?Since the beginning.The hand of a thief."Thou shalt not steal."John: Dead thief, cut off his hands.That was the first one.1926."Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy."Teeth... harvested from a field of migrant workers."Thou shall not worship false idols."What was left of Martin Gamboa's brain......after his skull was bashed open.No serial killer has a 90-year lull.If it's taken him this long to find a successor.Someone... to complete his work."Thou shall not commit adultery."James Briggs' tongue and eyes taken while he was still alive.John: That's bullshit.The parts cut out of James Briggs are in the lab.I catalogued it myself."Honor thy mother and thy father."The hearts of two ungrateful children.They murdered both of their parents in order to inherit the family fortune.John: The Rylance twins."Thou shalt not bear false witness."Gossip mongers.After he nailed their slanderous tongues to their desks, he ripped out their vocal cords."Thou shalt not take the Lord's name in vain."(sniffles)A false prophet who would go on television and vent his spleen.So the killer took it.(exhales)(softly): John.He...He would have had to have been bringing these things back while I was still here.Who let him in?Nobody let him in.He had a key.(whispers): What?Take my hand.What?John, take my hand.It's okay, baby.It's all okay, baby.You're here with me.(sniffles)With your Sally.We are almost there.There's just a little more work left to do.No. No. John, John, John.Stay with me. Stay. No, it's not true.March: This is my problem with police officers.All you care about is evidence.Evidence, evidence, evidence.(distorted, echoing scream)(gasps) John, look at me.Hahn: You're saying someone's picked up where this... this March guy left off?John: I don't remember anything.Anything at all.March: You have made yourself blind to everything but what your eyes can see.Sally: You remember everything.It's not true! John.Everything you did.And it's gonna happen again.And again and again.Wren.You can't stop it.No! It's not true!It's not possible.It's not possible.March: You've lived in my hotel long enough to know that what is impossible becomes... very possible here.(crying)(panting)It's you, John.It's always been you.♪ ♪Hahn: Any sign of him?Woman: No.He disappeared in all the commotion.Send someone out to his house.Make sure his wife and kid are okay.Thank you.♪Nice of you to look after my family.Jesus.John.You look terrible.I've come to confess.To helping this one escape?Assaulting a guard?We can make it go away.And what about murder?Multiple murders?Ten Commandment killings?Can you make those go away?John, what are you saying?Please!You think I've lost my mind?I'm here for you.Talk and I'll listen.I remember where it all began now.(exhales)It all started those first few days and nights at the Hotel Cortez.The first time you walked into that place was three weeks ago.These murders began months before that, John.The first time I walked into the Hotel Cortez was five years ago.I know that now.It was the same night we caught that multiple deaths call in Glassell Park.The dead family.Gunshot and asphyxiation.I needed a few drinks before I could bring myself to go home.More than a few.It's not as easy as you would think to find a drink in the middle of the night in Los Angeles.(Sally coughing)You sure you're in the right place, cowboy?♪I heard this is where a man could find the best martini in town.(gasps) Well, then, I guess you are in the right place.(clears throat)Another. Oh.Can I buy you your next one?I pay for my own drinks.It's cheaper than whatever it is you want from me.Just trying to be friendly. (chuckles)Do I look like I need a friend right now?Well, yeah.You want to go to a party upstairs?Liz's martinis are awfully expensive.But they're worth every penny.I'm not looking for a party tonight.I'm just looking to drink myself blind and forget.And I'm married.It's not that kind of party.Well, last call here is in five minutes.If you really want to get as blasted as you say you do, it's time to hit the after-party upstairs.(instrumental jazz music playing)Ms. Evers: You look radiant tonight, madam.Though I have no idea how one would launder something like that, all those sparkly bits.How is the outside, darling?Tell me about one of your recent kills.All you ever want to talk about are the kills. Pervert.(doorbell rings)Damn it, who is interrupting us?!I'll break the finger who dared ring that bell!Yummy.(pats shoulder)What's wrong with you, barging in on his night?Not that I mind, but a deal is a deal.March: I get one night!One night with her the whole month!Who is that with you?What is this, a... costume party?This is John.He's a detective, and he's had the kind of day that makes a man want to drink himself to death.Really?Jimmy loves to hear about the bad days.I'm The Countess.Countess of what?With those blue eyes, I'll be the countess of whatever you like, baby.Tell me, John, was someone killed?Did you have to discharge your revolver?No.But people died.Five of them. Children.And their father shot himself in the head because of it.Brains are still hanging off the ceiling.You speak about this with such calm indifference, as if life and death have no meaning to you.I'm a homicide detective.What I know is that death is the only thing in life that has any meaning.I was promised there'd be drinking up here.I'm thirsty.Leave us.I need to spend some real time with this man.But, darling... it's our night.Yes, dear, and usually I would hold that sacred, but there is something about John that has drawn me in, and so, therefore, I release you from your service.Good-bye, John.(door opens, closes)Absinthe.Yes, I know it's not technically legal, but no need to play Eliot Ness tonight.My name is James March.I own this hotel.What is that accent?You sound like a 1930s movie.You look like one, too.Ah, yes.I had a marvelous professor at Exeter.I freely admit that I mimicked his Brahman diction until I made it my own.As for my clothing, my choice of decor, the modern world is an awfully uncomfortable place, don't you think?Yes, I know the accoutrements of modern living allow an ease of communication, but the price paid for that is that no one actually sits and talks over a drink, like the good old days.Down the hatch.(sighs)Some time ago, we had a guest here at the Cortez named Kirlian.A photographer.He claimed to be able to use electricity to photograph a man's aura.I became fascinated by these auras.Over time, I began to be able to see a man's aura the moment I met him.The moment you walked into my suite, I was struck by the intensity of your aura.See, most folks radiate red or blue, purple if they're quite mystical, but yours... was jet black.Black as the ace of spades, as they say.What does that mean?Two schools of thought.One is that you have a protective cloak around you.It allows you to focus on any task at hand, regardless of the other's judgment.The other is that you have a need to dominate and control the world around you, bend it to your will.That is a man who is willing to do bad to do good.You are full of sh1t.And you are full of rage.Dangerous to keep it all inside, John.It will give you the cancer if you don't let it out sometimes.Tell me, have you ever roughed up a suspect a bit?(chuckles)Put him in handcuffs and then forgotten to read him his rights, and then just given him some good old-fashioned justice right there on the spot?You think I don't want to?I feel your constant battle to keep it in check.I once walked in on a 273D-- domestic dispute in progress.It took everything I had not to... pound this guy's face, make him swallow his own teeth and blood.Don't tell anyone that though.Why not?Why should you be ashamed?You would just be doing your job.My job is to arrest them.And how does that make you feel?When you collar a man, as opposed to letting your fists be jury and judge?If it was up to me?Yes. I don't need a judge to tell me whether someone's guilty or not. I know.I believe you, John.If they took the leash off me, crime would drop in this city.I truly do.John: We drank his absinthe.We talked for two straight days.We talked about the law-- man's law, God's law-- and about the meaning of true purpose and the meaningless of everything else.Most importantly, he helped me forget.(door creaks)March: He is the one.Countess: I don't want him, not now.He's been poisoned with that moonshine of yours.I didn't invite you here to feed off of him, you perverted animal.I need your help.He... is the one.All the others I've tried to mentor to finish my work--Gacy, Ramirez, that poof Dahmer-- all amateurs compared to this one.He won't do it.Why? This man has greatness in him.Once-in-a-generation rage.A man only has a grip as tight as he does because he knows that if he lets go, even slightly, he will hurl himself into the abyss.He won't let go.He still has hope.Easily remedied.He just needs a little shove.Why would I help you when it gives me so much joy to see you suffer?He has children.The boy is very beautiful.Like I said, he just needs a little push.A nudge into the darkest places of his heart.He needs to hate the whole world and everything in it.Mmm. (kisses)John: I didn't remember-- where, who with, what we did.It was lost time in my mind.Scarlett carpooled with Wendy. I'm late to take Holden.There's coffee though.I'm sorry, Alex.You should send a bottle of Scotch to your friend Hahn.He tried covering for you, at least for the first day and a half.I wasn't cheating on you.Of course you weren't cheating.If you were, you would have called and lied about where you were.You're a terrible husband.If we didn't have two kids and I didn't still love you, I would tell you to pack your bags.I'm sorry.It's just a slipup, that's all.Hey, buddy.Hey.(grunts)Are you home now, Daddy?John: Yeah, yeah.Hey, what do you say we all go to the beach this afternoon?I drove by and saw there's a big carnival or something going on down there. Yeah? Yay!All right, we got to run.Come on.I love you guys.We love you, too.(door opens, closes)Along with my son I lost everything else that mattered to me.There was always something more to do, until there wasn't.And after the volunteers had gone, and the house was empty, I was never more alone than being there with my wife.Hahn: You went through a boatload of sh1t, John.Child went missing.But you got through it.You pulled yourself together.
