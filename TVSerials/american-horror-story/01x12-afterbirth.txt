Honey, you got to come see this.I'm going to go.I'm taking Violet and going to Jo's.Florida?I want to get there before the school year starts.I don't understand.What about Los Angeles?I thought we agreed about the fresh start.I just can't.We really tried.We haven't tried.I can't do it anymore.Therapy isn't trying.It's just figuring stuff out so you can really do something.I've tried.And as much as I keep trying to let you in again, this wall comes up, and I... I can't...I can't get past it.Just look at this house.Look at this house I found...it's right nearHancock Park, where all those big mansions from the '20s are.You always talked about how much you wanted a house like this...one with personality.Well, here it is.You don't listen.The house isn't going to fix it, Ben.It's just a house, Viv.Come on.Take a look.It's nice, right?Tiffany lamps and everything.I don't know, maybe it's haunted or something.I mean, it's still a stretch at that price, but it's been on the market for a while,so maybe they'll go lower.There's even an office,so I can see patients at home.I mean, it's perfect.No.Honey... honey, the reason you can't hold on to this idea of leaving is because it's not what you want.I-I've been looking at houses for a month, and when I found this one, I swear to God, it was like a...it was like a laser beam shot right into my brain.I could see it all so clearly.It was like a movie in my mind.We were together...you, me and Violet...all around the fire.Violet was reading some depressing Russian novel,and I was stoking the fire,and you were on the couch rocking a baby.Honey... we have made so many life choices based on our gut, and right now...my gut is telling me that this place...this house is going to...it's going to break down that wall inside you.I'm sure it's a beautiful house.I love you so much.I'm begging you...just come see the house.The three of us will fly out.Just come see it.When I look at this place, for the first time, I feel...like there's hope.Vivien?Vivien!Violet!Vivien!Where are you, Vivien?Vivien!Where are you?We weren't expecting you until tomorrow.After the service.I know.But I can't impose on you like this, Constance.Don't be silly.Looking after this little angel is no imposition whatsoever.And I wouldn't think of burdening you with the care of a newborn during this time of your...unspeakable tragedy.Thank you, but...Vivien's sister is here now, so...Oh, I see.What a blessing distant relations are in times of trouble.If I could just get his things...Certainly, uh...though it is nearly his lunchtime.I know...why don't I feed him?He'll fall right asleep, and then you can come back in several hours.I can feed him.It's really no trouble at all.I'm here to get my son, Constance.Your son... of course.Let me just gather up his things.This formula has to be warmed up.All you have to do is run it under the hot water tap.I'll be fine.No, I don't believe you will.Nor will that child if you take him back into that house.Just give me his things.Dr. Harmon, hear me.There are forces in that house that mean to do this child grave harm.We both know that it's true.The same forces that killed your sweet wife.Oh, and what about your daughter?Tell me, Dr. Harmon, did you buy a casket for Violet, too?If that house can claim her spirit, what's going to happen to this sweet little baby?The baby's going to be fine.Oh, you are a fool!After everything that you've seen...after everything that has happened, how can you still be so blind?Hello?Hey, it's Ben Harmon, Tate's therapist.Yeah, I'm calling because I can't treat your son anymore.I'd like... I'd like to give you the number of another psychiatrist who I think could help him.Oh, no, but why, Doctor?Because your son has crossed a line with my daughter.Oh, but...I'm so sorry.Where is he?In his grave.Where he's been longer than he lived on this Earth.You destroyed my family.You!You are paying for your own sins, Dr. Harmon.Let me give you some advice.When I leave here, lock your door and pray I don't come back.I wonder, how is your adjustment going?I have to say one of the hardest things is watching Ben.He's so devastated.Yes, well, it's always the living that make it hard.Hmm.You don't need to run off, dear.He can't see you unless you want him to.Right. Keep forgetting.I want to nurse him so badly.No, Ben.Not the microwave.You're hovering, dear.It's a bad idea.See, he remembered.He was a good dad.Moira, I know you don't approve, but despite all his flaws...he's a good father.I'll never understand why you always need to come to his defense.Here you go.Do you want him to see you?Is that what's going on?Are you fighting the desire to appear?No, I do not want him to see me.I absolutely do not want him to see me or Violet.I have made her promise me, because if he see us, then he is going to want to stay here.It's okay, kiddo.And he has to leave this house.And raise our baby.Then sit down and keep your distance.Remember the endgame.It's all going to work out.There's something about Ben that's different.He's so sanguine.Perhaps he's dreaming of all the women he can have relations with.Forgive me.I suppose that was unkind.Moira, would you make me a cup of tea, please?No.Your denial is impressive.You're a ghost, Mrs. Harmon.I don't take orders from ghosts.I'm your equal now in this world.So you are.I owe you an apology.And I think you should call me Vivien.I'd like that.Vivien, if I may...Leave him be.Don't torture yourself.It's not your fault.None of this is.Your Aunt Jo's going to be here soon.Okay.Okay. Okay.It's okay.You can't do this.Vivien.I knew you were here.Why didn't you come to me?It would just make it worse.I want you to take the baby and go.No, just let me do it, then we can be together.No, no, no! No.That baby needs a father, Ben.I'm not his father.You know it, and I know it.He's my baby, and you shouldn't be smoking.I don't really care where it came from.I would give anything if I could take care of him.Vivien, I am...so sorry for everything I put you through.I want you to hear me.I forgive you.So enough with the drama and the tragedy.We've had enough in this family.We've had enough.And the one spot of light that there is, is that baby asleep upstairs.That's your opportunity to do something different.I want you to take the baby, and I want you to leave this house, and I want you to never come back.Your sister said she would take care of him.She's a good mother.No, I don't want that.What do you want?I want to...envision you with that boy on your shoulders walking down Newbury Street.What about Violet?What about Violet?I'm a teenage girl.Not exactly a cakewalk.Violet.What kind of father have I been?You weren't eating.You weren't going to school.You were already gone, and... I didn't get it.I shut you out.I was afraid it would break you.I miss you so much.I was never getting into Harvard.Oh...But I saved you a shitload of money.Yeah, you did.You have to leave, Dad.Every minute you're in this house, you're in danger, and so is that baby.Please.Do it for us.Where are you going, Ben?You didn't think I'd just let you leave?Get out of my way, Hayden.I don't have time for your bullshit.Ah!Now we have all the time in the world.Welcome!You must be the Ramos.Yes. I'm Stacy.Mm-hmm.This is my husband Miguel.Hi.Miguel.What an exotic name.I must confess to a fascination for all thgs south of the border.Actually, my family's from Spain.Yeah.All the better.I find European Hispanics vastly superior.This is a classicL.A. Victorian, built in the1920s by a doctor to the stars.As you can see, it's just fabulous.These are real Tiffany fixtures.Yeah?Everything else in the house has been updated.Uh, Gabriel.Hold on.Uh, I apologize for my son.Apparently he's got the skateboard surgically attached to his body.He doesn't go anywhere without it.It's quite all right, Mr. Ramos.As long as we don't leave any marks on the floor.Are we waiting for another sibling?No, we just have the one.Thank you.The furnishing is from the previous owner, but if you see anything that you like, I'm sure the estate is open to selling at the right price.This is amazing, babe.Look at this house.Um, speaking of money, Marcy, I know the, uh, economy is down, but why is the asking price so far below market?There isn't a problem with mold or radon, is there?No. Nothing so simple.In the interest of full disclosure, I must inform you that the previous owners passed away in the house.Oh.How?The wife died during childbirth, and the husband, in his grief, committed suicide.He hung himself from the second-story balcony.It's a tragically romantic love story.This is their dog, Hallie.She's the only remaining member of the Harmon family.I've adopted her.Well, at least they weren't murdered.Mrs. Ramos.Yes? I'd be happy to show you another house.But no matter where you go, you'll be moving into somebody's history.Only this one can be had for$200,000 less than the last time I sold it.What do you think, Gabe?I don't believe in ghosts.Ah.Of course he would say that.Should we continue the tour?Yes. Sure.I know you're going to love the kitchen.It's got marble countertops, a breakfast nook, and have you ever seen a pasta arm?No.No.Personally, I haven't... I live alone...but Mrs. Harmon fancied herself a bit of a gourmet.Notice the gazebo in the backyard.Ow.You okay?Yeah.I-I slipped.Where-where's Mom?Oh, the second she stepped foot in the kitchen, it was game over.I think we just bought ourselves a house.Come on, you gotta check out the rest of this place.There's definitely room for a pool table.Imagine sipping a nice mojito on a hot summer day.I guess you folks tolerate the heat better than us gringos.Am I right?I see you've got a new family moving in next door.Yes, I noted that.Oh, I do hope they're a... nice family.I'd go over there and welcome them personally, but as you may imagine, returning to that house is difficult for me.After what I saw.You stupid son of a bitch.Please tell me that you're not here with any more bad news.No real news, actually.So you still haven't found that precious baby?No trace.That's very... worrying.We'd like to go over your statement again.Just to make sure we didn't miss anything.Of course. You said you'd gone over to the Harmons' at approximately7:30 p.m.To check on Dr. Harmon and his daughter.After ringing the bell and getting no response, you decided to enter the premises.Being no stranger to tragedy, I was understandably concerned.Prescient, as it turned out.You stupid son of a bitch.I can't believe she killed me.Serves you right.My first instinct was to flee.To run screaming and never return.But then I tenhought of the bab.sh1t.Dad?Well, that's all very touching.But where the hell's the baby?So I went searching for the Harmons' daughter.And when I discoveredthat she was gone, too...I understood what must have happened.Have you come to see my baby?I've come to fch my grandson.Oh, you think so?Mrs. Harmon agrees with me.House of the dead is no place to raise a child.It is for this baby.He's special.He's mine.Over my dead body.We're well past that.Aw, sh1t.Violet took that child, and fled.God knows where.But I keep them both in my prayers, every night.Well...If you, uh, think of anything Violet said to you that could, uh, indicate where she might have gone, you will let us know?Oh, without hesitation.Thank you for your time.Aw...Who's my good little angel, huh?Who's my good little angel?Oh..OhOh, there's my good little angel.Huh?Who are you?You have awful taste in music.Butthole Surfers?Hello? Breaking and entering.Who are you?A ghost of my former self.Violet. I live in the neighborhood.Your hand's cold.You know what they say.Cold hands, warm heart.Hmm.Yo!Don't you have any Ramones?Like Animal Boy,or Too Tough To Die?Hey. Get out of my room.Are you sure you want to be alone?They say this house is haunted.You're kind of twisted, aren't you?You don't know the half of it.Whoa.You okay?Yeah. This floor is warped.You know who's warped?That realtor, Marcy.You think?I think she's hot.Red hot.Smokin' hot.Really?Mm.I may have to waste that bitch, then.Hey. There's enough of me to go around.Well, I'm not into sharing.Oh.Mm-hmm.Are we gonna christen the house tonight?Hmm.Does this answer your question?Mmm.This does.Babe...Gabe's upstairs.Shh.I remember when we were like that.In the beginning.Mmm.To be continued.Uh-huh.On that note.Yes?Gabe's graduating this year.This house is so big.Do you think we'll be lonely?
