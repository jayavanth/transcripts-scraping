I walked along the avenue I never thought I'd meet a girl like you Meet a girl like you With auburn hair and tawny eyes The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through Looks like we can't go any further.You sure this is where you want to go?My GPS shows there's nothing up there.Yeah, it must be where the access road used to be.Looks like I'll have to hike it from here.Thanks.I'll find it.- What are you looking for?- Camp Redwood.Oh.Night and day Don't forget to give me five stars!What's that?In your hand.Uh, it's my phone.That's not a phone.Are-are you Amish or something?Can I?S-Sure.Oh, sh1t.That's rad.What year is this?Are you serious?Just tell me, asshole.It's 2019.Oh, my God.You're the first new guy I've seen here in, like, forever.After that shitshow in '89, I began to notice a lot less people were coming into camp.Not even the hard-core death tourists.Few years later, nobody.We were forgotten.Something else must have gotten their attention.- Now I know what.- I'm sorry.Were you even alive in 1989?And-and you said "We".Who-who else is here?You got to get out of here.You're in danger.Everyone you see here is likely to kill you.Including you?Can I keep this?No.There's no reception up here anyway.And I'm not leaving, not until I get some answers.I'm trying to find out what happened to my father.I know he was here.Your father?My name is Bobby Richter.Bobby.You're Mr.Jingles' son.American Horror Story: 1984 9x09 Final Girl I've done a lot of research on this place and everything that happened here.I know this sounds crazy, but you look just like Ah.Yep.That's me.It's a headshot I did for the aerobics studio.They put all the instructors' mugs on the wall.That's impossible.Montana Duke died.And even if she didn't, she'd be in her 50s.What's going on here?I'll tell you, but you first.What's going on out there?We don't have TV here, so we have no idea.What's the music like?What do people do to stay in shape?Who's the president?Uh, what did people think of the '80s?Did Judd Nelson ever get his Oscar?Uh, no.I don't think so.Um, I don't know.The '80s are having a little comeback now.I mean, people like the clothes and the music, but aerobics is kind of a joke these days.Oh, come on, man.You break into this camp just to break my heart?That is the saddest thing I've ever heard.Mwah.You're-you're-you're-you're Trevor Kirchner.You're the guy who was married to Margaret Booth.You-you have, you have an enormous, uh Personality?Hey.This doesn't make any sense.He's Mr.Jingles' son Bobby.Whoa.Yeah.I was raised by my aunt.She died last year, and on her deathbed she told me the truth about my father.She said someone murdered my mother and he came here to avenge her death.She kept it a secret so I'd be protected, but he was never heard from again.I've also been receiving checks all my life sent anonymously.And I think it's him.I think he's been sending me money all these years and I just, I-I have to talk to him.I'm sorry, dude.Your dad's dead.Well are you, are you sure?'Cause there-there's so much about him that doesn't fit.I mean, the guy who worked at VideoShack is not the same killer that I've read so much about.Who was he?I don't think we'll ever know.He came back here to do good, but dark forces took him away.The last time I saw him, he was dragged into the lake.Haven't seen him since.None of the ghosts have.Ghosts?Yeah.We're all dead.This is such bullshit.- Ooh.Smart.You brought protection.- Hey!Hey Hey.- Here, shoot me.- In the head.I got shot in the pecker once.- It stung like a bitch.- Mm.No, I'm not gonna shoot you.You're such a pussy.Come on.Me next, me next.Come on.Oh, come on What else you got?Here we go.Aw, a knife.Stab me.Come on.No.What?Yo!What is happening?This doesn't make any sense.What's going on?It's a long story.It was Halloween 1989.Margaret Booth had everything lined up.The stage was set for a massacre.The talent was supposed to be here 45 minutes ago.You're my attorney.I want you to call their reps and find out why they haven't shown.We have signed contracts, yes?Well, see to it that those contracts are executed, because if they aren't, you will be.Wait.Does that mean I don't get to kill Debbie Gibson?I don't care about the openers.But I was promised Billy Idol.If he doesn't show, I'm going to be very, very upset.I think I know why the bands aren't here.And?Spit it out.It's Trevor.He's blocked the road.He's turning people around, sending 'em away.I think he's trying to shut us down.I personally had to say goodbye to Belinda Carlisle.And why would he be doing that?Because he hates you.And he roots for your failure.And maybe I might have accidentally told him about Kajagoogoo getting murdered.You are the world's worst assistant.Well, I wouldn't say "the worst" Clean this up.I have something I have to go deal with.I'm working hard Yeah, I'm-I'm so sorry, but the fire department has shut us down.I'm so sorry to say the festival has been canceled.Turn up Sorry, ladies.The fire department shut us down.You're gonna have to get the beat somewhere else.Yeah, the water main blew, so the whole place is flooded.Sorry, no refunds.Sit and spin, asshole!Now listen.Trevor?!What the hell are you doing?!I know about Kajagoogoo.- That wasn't me.- Either way, you're complicit.Am I supposed to be afraid of that knife, Trevor, huh?Death is our business, a business you had no moral objection to when it paid for your Porsche 928 and enough coke to keep an elephant up for a week.Show's over.You are true evil.And I let myself be corrupted by that evil, but this is my redemption song.For the first time in my life, I have found real love, and it has freed me.I'm shutting you down, Margaret.I'm going to the authorities, and I am filing for divorce!Trevor, darling, haven't you heard?People can run from me, but they never get away.I should've shot you when I saw you rolling around with that truck stop Cyndi Lauper.You murderous bitch.You'll never get away with this.Oh, yes, I will.Look around, ding-dong.You're not in Camp Redwood anymore.You're on the other side of the property line.So if you die here, dead is all you'll ever be, and you will never see that bitch again.Thanks for nothing, fuck-face!Wow.And I should've died, but fate had other plans for me.No!No!Trevor!Trevor!Trevor, can you hear me?- Montana - Trevor, please get up.Please.You can't die out there.Please!Please Trevor!Come on, baby, you can do it.You can do it, baby.Come on, Trev.Trevor, come on, baby, just a few more feet.Just a few more.Come on.Trevor, you can do it.I'm sorry.I'm sorry.Don't you dare f*cking touch him.- You're not gonna make it.- Leave him alone!You already took my brother!Don't you dare take the best dick that happened to me!Come on.No, Trevor.Okay, come on.Trevor.Why would you help me?Because I'm not like you.It's okay, babe.You can go.You can go.You saved me, babe.Wait, so Brooke Thompson escaped death row?I'd hated her for so long.And she knew it, too.But she saved him anyway.And that simple act it changed me forever.She was right.All that hatred had turned me into a terrible person.And I didn't want to be like that anymore.I decided all the killing had to stop.The ghosts we could reason with.We all had our differences, but we shared the same fate.You know?So it bonded us.We became a community.It was Margaret's bloodlust that we needed to end.Problem was, she was working with two very dangerous men.You're my seventh solo kill.Die, bitch.Looks like it's only gonna be six.Sorry, hombre.Bitchin' 'stache, but I can't have you die on this property.You're gonna rot in the Angeles Forest.Public land.Killing that asshole was easy.No muss, no fuss.But Ramirez was a different monster.Ricky.Is that you?Montana.Holy sh1t, babe.I can't believe you're actually here.I haven't been able to stop thinking about you.I've missed you, too.But the festival seems like a bust, so I'm gonna go kill this kid in Alaska.That's too bad.'Cause there hasn't been a real man up here in so long.Not here.I got a better place.Get ready to lose your sh1t, babe.'Cause Billy Idol wants to meet you.- He's a huge fan.- Mm.I know about the roadblock.I know that Idol isn't here.Dude, he freaking made it through, because Billy Idol is a survivor!Come on, think about it.You can't sing "Rebel Yell" and not be a rebel.- Oh.- Yeah.Babe, sorry.Everybody's always coming for the king, so I got to be on my guard.I get it.Come on.Billy's waiting.So, where's Billy?He's coming.Aw, f*ck me.This is my redemption, dickwad.I'm gonna be the one to end you.- You bitch!- And you're a sick f*ck who gets his rocks off slicing up grannies.Does that make you feel like a man?You're pathetic!We're gonna make you pay for all of eternity for all the fucked-up sh1t you've done.You're not supposed to be here!- Whoo!- Yeah!I'll come back.I'll come back for all of you.No.I'm counting on it.But why didn't you make sure that he died outside of camp?Why trap his soul in here with all of you?Ramirez already died once back in '84, and the devil brought him right back to life.In minutes, he was flesh and blood again.As in, he could moonwalk right out of this place, - go anywhere.- If we were gonna keep Beelzefuck from fully reincarnating the prick, Ramirez was gonna need to be under constant supervision.So for 30 straight years, that's exactly what we've given him.A literal death watch.There are over 40 souls here.We all take turns.The second he wakes, we're on him like flies on sh1t.Good morning.Dark Father, heal my wounds.Give me strength to devour From here on out, all you're ever gonna feel is pain.We're constantly coming up with new horrible ways to kill him.After all the dreadful sh1t he did to so many people, he deserves to suffer.f*ck.So that's how we've been able to keep him at bay.We're doing this to keep you safe.Me?You're the first person he'd come for.The son of Jingles he swore to kill.The boy in Alaska.And he wouldn't just kill you.He'd make you suffer.Your dad wanted you protected from Ramirez, - and so we took up the mantle.- Wait.So all this time, all these years, you've you've been saving my life?Yeah.Thank you.It's no big deal.What really matters is that we get you out of here.This is the worst possible place you could be.Well, I appreciate what you've done for me, but you're wrong.I mean, if no one dies here, that means I can actually talk to my dad.What part of "we haven't seen him" don't you get?He's been MIA for, like, 30 years, dude.I'm not leaving.Not until I find him.Seems like he's taking longer to wake up.Probably get another round of Pictionary in.What do you say we make it interesting?Like, um loser has to strip?Mm.You can't be serious.As a heart attack, stud muffin.Now, pick a card, start scribbling, and maybe you'll get lucky.Not like I don't know you swing both ways.Why would you say that?Because you sleep with everyone.What can I say?I'm an equal opportunity lover.Hmm.All the years we've been here, you've never thought about tangling with someone more mature?Someone who could teach you a thing or three?What are you afraid of?That you'll open Pandora's box, which you will never want to close?Vengeance.Vengeance.Vengeance.Vengeance.Seems like you two opened that Pandora's Box after all.Oh, sh1t.I mean, if no one dies here, that means I can actually talk to my dad.What part of "we haven't seen him" don't you get?I'm not leaving, not until I find him.Okay, I understand your need for closure.But even if you do find him, I'm not really sure that Mr.Jingles is gonna give you the warm and fuzzies that you're looking for.I have to try.Run, Bobby, run, he's the Night Stalker!Come on!The f*ck, dude?sh1t!Somebody f*cked up.- Keep it moving, sweetheart.- Die, m*therf*cker!Run, Bobby, run!Vengeance.You're just like your dad.You fight like a pussy.Your father betrayed Satan.I'm here to collect his debt.It's going to be lots of fun.Not so much for you.- Get him!- Listen to me.- Run and never come back.Come on.- No.Go to Red Meadows Asylum.Find the medical director, and you'll get your answer.Go, Bobby!I need to see the medical director.Yo, you're in the wrong kind of hospital.- This ain't no ER.- I'm fine.Please.It's very important.She's kind of indisposed right now.Maybe I could take a message?No!I'm sorry.I've-I've had a very long day, and I just need a few minutes of her time.Please.Okay.No problem.Have a seat over there.I'll see what I can do.- Thank you.- Yeah.Hi.It's Jess.I got a guy here in the lobby.Someone that needs your attention.Thank you.Take it easy now.Just gonna get you cleaned up.What?No, no, no, no, no, no, no.I'm not I'm not here for that.- I'm just here to get some information.- You're in good company.Lot of people here looking for information.Frequencies.Chupacabras.- Fun group.- Listen, it's about Benjamin Richter.Wait.What about Richter?He was my father.I knew your father.You did?How?How doesn't matter.What matters is that you know this.When they locked him up in here, they locked up an innocent man.But, uh, there was so much evidence.Evidence planted by the real killer.Margaret Booth.Margaret Booth.But she-she was she was a victim.She testified at the trial.She was missing an ear.She was thorough.I'll give her that.Opportunistic.Smart.A straight up psychopath.Put all that into a blender, and you got one of the most vicious serial killers of the 20th century.And she almost got away with it.Almost.Until that Halloween night - in 1989.- No.No, no, no.I cannot wait any longer.I need someone to come.I need someone to move that bus right now.Hel Hello?Oh, you've got to be kidding me.Hello?Margaret Booth.Oh, sh1t.What the f*ck are you doing here?!To kill you, you crazy bitch.Bitch!No!No!- Take her.- No, no, no, no, no!We can talk about this.Just tell me what you want.Your head on a stick.Hold her steady, boys.You can't kill me here.You'll just turn me into one of you.Way ahead of you, Mags.Shoot her over the property line.Oh, my, my.This is so gratifying.Is there a puree setting on it?You're too late.I'm already dying.Actually, the brain can live on for about 30 seconds after decapitation.Oh!What the f*ck?Margaret finally got what she had coming to her.I just wish Brooke was alive to see it.So, then, Brooke was a patsy just like my dad.I tried to do right by her.Give her a new life.But she just couldn't outrun what happened to her at that camp.It pulled her back in and eventually it killed her.So you were the last one.The only one.The final girl.I went back a few times to check in, pay my respects.But it was hard for them seeing someone like me that could change, grow old.Someone with a life.Thank you.Telling you the truth is the least I can do.I mean for the money.The checks.All this time, I thought it was my dad sending them, but it was you, wasn't it?I don't know what you're talking about.I never sent you anything.Well, then, there must be someone else who knows.Someone else who made it out.Maybe you weren't the final girl after all.Oh.Oh, Christ.Oh, I could never live here.Changed my socks twice already.Recognize anyone?Any chance we have the wrong address?No chance.The routing number on your checks is a small savings and loan.Only one branch, and it's right here in Prineville, Oregon.Why are you doing this for me?Who says I'm doing this for you?Oh.Bogey coming in.Oh, my God.What took you so long?Here we go.Sorry, I don't have real sugar.Just Splenda.Black's fine for me, thanks.Is that how you stay looking the way you do after 30 years?Splenda?Turns out leaving behind a life of hostility and revenge does wonders for your skin.And having a dermatologist husband doesn't hurt either.I took all the stress that was pumping through my body and swapped it for premium fillers.I'm kidding.Kind of.Looks like you broke yourself off a nice slice of life here.Doctor husband, good-looking kids.Donna, I-I know I I owe you an apology.Do you have any idea how much guilt I was carrying around after I left you at that place?How could you not let me know you were alive?I did.I-I called.I just could never say "hello".As soon as I heard your voice, I'd start shaking.The memories of Redwood would come flooding back in.I hung up every time.But there wasn't a day that went by that I didn't think of you.And I'm sorry.I just I didn't know any other way to move on.I'm not mad at you for having a good life.I just wish I could've been a part of it.Yeah.And I'll be damned if I can figure out how you got out.I watched you die.No, Brooke.No.You're alive.Ah, the bullet went right through.Okay, just keep pressure here, okay?Hold it tight.I'll get you - some bandages.- And iodine.And iodine.I remember.Come on.It's all right.It's all right.- All right.- I don't want to die here.You're not gonna die here.You deserve better.You always have.Come on.All right, come on.I can't help you any further.You got to get across on your own.I'm sorry you have to stay here.You don't deserve this, either.Thank you.Oh.I woke up in a white room.I thought it was heaven until I felt all of this pain.I guess someone called from the camp pay phone, and paramedics got me to the hospital.As soon as I got my strength back, I got out of there, headed north and kept going.You've always been a fighter.I should've known better than to count you out.No, but I still don't understand.I mean, what ?After all my father did to you, why did you help me?Why did you seek me out and send me money all these years?I-I know it's-it's hard to understand, but I needed to believe that a normal life was possible after Camp Redwood.A glimmer of hope after all that darkness.Your dad was that for me.He moved to Alaska, got married, had a baby.He was on his way, and the camp pulled him back, just like it pulled me back when I had a chance to be free.And I knew that eventually it would pull you in, too, so I did what I could to give you a chance to be free of that awful legacy.So I guess, in the end, I did it for me just as much as for you.Thank you.Donna, I hope some day you can forgive me.We're bonded for life.We're the ones that got away.Yeah.I guess we're both the final girl.Come on.- I'll buy you lunch.- Nah, it's okay.You're going back to that camp, aren't you?I felt something when I was there, like someone watching over me.Um, I don't know.Maybe it was him.Brooke was right.Once that place has a hold on you, it never lets go.You're not gonna find what you're looking for.Thanks for all your help, Donna.Hello.I'm sorry.Did I scare you?I know you.Does anyone really ever know anyone?You're Margaret Booth.You framed my father.You're Jingles Junior.Did you come back here to find your father?I can take you to him.They said no one's seen him for 30 years.Well, not everyone can find him, but we have a long history.I don't trust you.Okay, don't see your father.I don't care.They told me they killed you.So you couldn't come back.Well, technically, I died a second before the chipper spit me out on the other side, so I've been here all along.But I've been hiding.- And waiting.- For what?To kill you!f*ck!You always found a way to hurt me.You think I would let you hurt my son?She'll be back.We have to get you out of here now.Dad.Why did you come back here?I was never a parent to you.You're wrong.You-you You did what all good parents do.You You sacrificed yourself for your child.I just had to come back and say "thank you".You are worth it.Every bit of it.Now forget this place and go live.And know I will always love you.That's all that matters, okay?Don't you get it?This is how it has to be.I win!I am the final girl.I am always the final girl.Leave him alone.He deserves a happy ending.Why?Because he's innocent?Please.There is no such thing.So handsome.Just like my Bobby would have looked if he'd grown up.Take her.Get out of here and never come back.But don't forget us.Tell our ghost stories to your children, and we'll live on forever.The '80s will never die.Now get out of here.Go, Bobby, go.
