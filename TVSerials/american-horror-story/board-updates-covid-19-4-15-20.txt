Update 4/15/20: Thank you for so many emails/requests the past month. We've taken a time out on posting new updates due to the illness. Eventually as we feel better we will resume and get so many of the shows up to date again. Thank you for your understanding and compassion during this difficult time. Stay Safe.****If this site is down you can read current status updates on our facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/foreverdreaming.org/ Please, try not to overwhelm us by sending emails as that takes away time from us trying to fix any issues.Thank you for your support and understanding!If you would like to help edit any of our transcripts with character names, locations or just fix spacing or sentence structure please contact me via our facebook page as well. You are welcomed to send us updated transcripts for us to replace on this site or if you want to be a board Editor of an entire forum - just tell us which forum and what you'd like your board username to be and we'll set you up! No experience needed to volunteer! Serious inquires only.
