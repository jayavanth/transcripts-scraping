VINCENT: Congratulations on your big win, Kai.I couldn't be more proud.I have to stay sharp.For the men.How's your leg?It's, uh, it's stiff.But it's good.I'll live.I got your edible arrangement in the hospital, by the way.It was very thoughtful.I figured the reason you didn't come visit me yourself was because you were ashamed.I mean, it was your patient who colluded with the woman who tried to murder me.(sighs)Allyson Mayfair-Richards is a sick woman.But you're not far off, I was ashamed.I mean, you've accomplished so much, Kai.Running for office, starting a whole movement.And I didn't know about any of it.I'm just proud of you.I don't need you to play Dad, Vincent.You're just as bad at it as he was.I look after myself.You think that I want to be like that prick, Kai?No.I'm-I'm trying to apologize.Listen, what you are doing here-- organizing all of these people, making a difference-- it's awesome.You think so?Absolutely.And I want to help you get your message out.With the right strategy, this could be a national movement.- Yes.- Yes.You know, I was thinking about making some videos for social media.- (snaps fingers)- That's genius.And I-I could film it.Thanks, big bro.Of course.Oh, there's just one more thing I need from you.From now on, call me Councilman.- Enjoy your meal.- (spits)I'm not eating this sh1t.Kai told us to start making you healthy food.(laughs)You bitches are so sensitive.You know, your bangability would go way up if you just smiled.Ooh.(laughter)(knife clatters)GUTTERBALL: She does have a nice ass, though.I can't put up with this sh1t much longer!I'm being treated like a servant in my own restaurant.How did this Handmaid sh1t even happen?hours ago, we were on the verge of toppling the patriarchy!That's before he had a goddamn army.That's not an army!That's a bunch of dude-bros with too much time on their hands.Yeah?Tell that to the other city council members.You weren't at that meeting last night.That's six votes in favor.Perry?I understand the appeal of private security, but we already have a police force, not to mention countless community neighborhood watch groups.Do we really want to spend taxpayer money to put more men with guns on the streets in our neighborhoods?That makes me uncomfortable.Really?I know you live in a gated community.Not everyone can afford that.And even your two beautiful daughters have to leave those gates to go to school, don't they?and , am I right?Now, just how comfortable would you feel if something terrible were to happen to them?You'd never forgive yourself, would you?I vote yes.KAI: And with that, the motion passes.(gavel bangs)BEVERLY: We let this sh1t go too far already.But I've been thinking about this.Those boys are just grunts.They don't so much as take a sh1t unless he tells them to.But if we cut off the head of the snake, the entire army falls.You can't go after Kai.It'd be a suicide mission.And I don't just mean us, I mean the movement.We need him.Why do you keep on defending him?Look, I'm not happy about being put on kitchen duty, either, but it's all part of his larger plan.There is no plan.He is not fit to lead.- You don't know him.- You have to decide if you are with us or against us.You think big brother's gonna spare you?Reward your loyalty?Wake up, little girl.Kai's gonna do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants, even if that includes sacrificing baby sis.He does not give a sh1t about you.You're wrong!Kai would never hurt me.I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for him.WINTER: It was two years ago. Halloween.We were doing what we always did: trolling the social justice warriors.But that was too easy."Why should we allow abortion "for the health of the mother "when the baby is the only part of that duo without sin?" (laughing)KAI: "Kill the mother, save the baby." WINTER: We hit the jackpot in the Dark Web.We would pretend to be one of the true believers, then we would go farther than anyone could possibly go.Wait, I got one. Okay..."Man can never escape from temptation "because, in birth, he passes through the v*g1n*, "which has been desecrated by the filthy act of sexual intercourse." (smacks lips)- (laughs): Get out.- (message alert chimes)That was when we got a private message from someone named Pastor Charles."You are worthy of an invitation"?- Wait, from who?- Yes!These people are dangerous, Kai.KAI: They're posers.Messing with them in person will be a million times more fun.KAI: Whoa! Judgment House?We're going.WINTER: Judgment House turned out to be a farm in Wixom near Highway .Time to see the animals in their cages.Where's everyone else?(door creaks)Hello, brother.Pastor Charles, I presume.I brought my sister, Winter.What is this place?Oh, it's a house of mirth to some.The portent to those whose eyes are open but cannot see.Once you enter, you agree to never share the provenance of what you've seen inside.Our secret to have and to hold.Till death do us part?Punishment is your everlasting soul.(door creaks shut)I'm the watchman.This way.(door closes)(door slams shut)sh1t. The door's locked.Well......only one way to go.(flames whooshing)(recording of baby crying)PASTOR CHARLES (over speaker): Who shall speak for the unborn?(recording of baby crying continues)WOMAN (moaning): Help me.Help me.I killed my baby.Now I'm bleeding to death.(whimpers)Bummer.(quietly): Help me, please.He kidnapped me.He's making me do this.This isn't a show.(cries): This is not a show.- What the f*ck?- She's really good.- (whimpering)No, no.- You're good.- (sobbing)- This... Jesus Christ.(sniffs)(sobbing)This is real blood.(sobbing): Help me.Help me.PASTOR CHARLES: Wide is the gate and broad the way which leadeth to destruction.(buzzing)WINTER: We got to get out of here. Come on.KAI: Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.Wait, wait, wait. Wait.(woman whimpering)- sh1t!- (panting)WINTER: I knew after the first room, that what we saw was real.Not actors in a haunted house.It smells like death in here.PASTOR CHARLES: Behold the whirlwind of the Lord.It shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.KAI: He's alive.Hey, man.- (screaming)- Aah!No more.He's corrupted me by the drugs of my choice: ecstasy, cocaine, opioids.My body is a bag of mush.I'm dying from the inside out.WINTER: Oh, my God.Get the f*ck out of here.What of the sodomite?(loud bang, door creaks open)MAN (sobbing quietly): Help me, please.Please...you got to get me out of here.The seducer of the innocent...toward the wicked filth of strange flesh.- Did the Lord not say...- Come on, Kai, we have to go.- No!- that man shall not lie with man as with woman?- He can't do this to people.- It is an abomination!The blood shall be on their heads.The Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone.Behold, His judgment is...it is ever swift and divine!And in uncertain times, - what vengeance - When he finishes talking...shall mark their days?...knives will burst through my chest.PASTOR CHARLES: A plague to slow their way...MAN: I saw it happen to the guy before me....or the strike of swift justice!- Holy sh1t.- I don't want to see this anymore.No, we have to get him out of here.- PASTOR CHARLES: His judgment is ever swift!- Help me!PASTOR CHARLES (softly): His punishment a slow... burning... fire.(trembling breath)MAN (whimpering): Oh, my God.Hurry.(man trembling, panting)Go get help.We're getting everyone out of here.Now!Come on.(quietly): sh1t.WINTER: No...sh1t.Yes.I see in your eyes a true connection to the wretched souls in here.I think you need to be in the show.- (thump)- (grunts)(gasps softly)KAI: Okay, you sick b*st*rd, this girl you kidnapped after her appointment at Planned Parenthood, and all she had was a UTI.This guy, you took from rehab when he was trying to sober up.And my friend here was at an AIDS clinic volunteering his time.How many people have you condemned for no reason?I do not answer to you or your laws.GIRL: We're gonna call the police, and then you're going to prison.KAI: That's not justice.He doesn't deserve anything less than what he was willing to put you through.I say we do what's right.Winter?(Pastor Charles mumbles inaudibly)Kill the m*therf*cker.WINTER: Everything changed after Pastor Charles.He started popping Adderall, went deeper into the Dark Web, but he realized he can't save everyone.Better to burn it all down and build a new world.I know you guys hate him right now, he's lost his way, but we can put him back on the right path.I'll go to him.He'll listen to me.(softly): I know, baby.You're right.BEVERLY: Fine.We'll try it your way.But come the end of the week, if I'm still in this goddamn kitchen, I'm coming for your brother.And you better get the hell out of my way.KAI: So...the girls are restless.WINTER: No.We just feel kind of left out.I mean, Jesus, Kai, you have us working in a kitchen.Well, I was gonna put Harrison in the kitchen, but...somebody killed him.You're still mad about that?No.Actually, I'm not.Come here.Sit with me.(breathes deeply)Total honesty.Absolute truth.Do you love me?Will you always be loyal to me?You make it so hard sometimes.It's time for you to understand your place in the bigger picture.I must have your vow.- Yes.- Yes?(laughs, sobs)Kai?What's wrong?I've never seen you interrupt a pinky-power before.(Kai sobbing)I just love you so much.Our family.- You love our family?- Yeah.The one we're going to make.What?The work we've begun is the work of generations, Winter.We're just the seed.And from that seed, from the blood we share, a savior will arise to carry on our mission.You......will be the mother of our messiah baby.Kai, we can't have a baby.That's incest.No, no, no.I'm not suggesting that at all.- Samuels.- Samuels?He's beautiful, don't you think?He will be the instrument of our union.Our union?Yes.As he enters you, I will enter him.That way, I will be the father, but you will remain pure and unsoiled.You cool with that?ALLY: I need you to leave.Okay, if we, if we can just sit for a second.I don't care to sit, and why are you still in my house?- You're unhappy, I get it.- Unhappy?Why would I be unhappy?Because you had me locked up in a psych ward for three weeks?I told you why, Ally.It was to keep you safe.Bullshit.Since when have you given a damn about my safety or the safety of my family?I have been coming to you for months, begging for your help, telling you exactly what's been going on.Did you even listen to me?(exhales)You never believed a word I said, did you?- Did you?- I do now.I do now.All of it.And the man that has been terrorizing you is more dangerous than you know.(scoffs)What do you know about him?He's my brother.He's my little brother.ALLY (quietly): Wait a minute.This-this is my nanny.Wait, is Winter your sister?- Yes.- Oh, Jesus Christ.Your sister is screwing my wife!I'm sorry I wasn't listening, at least not clearly enough.It-it never occurred to me that you were talking about my brother.Oh, my God.What?That's how he did it.That's how he got inside my head.- It was you.- No.No, no.- No, no.No.- I told you everything.- About the clowns, the holes, all of it!-Absolutely not.What was I, some kind of amusing conversation at a family dinner?VINCENT: He must've broken into my office and accessed my case files.This is all your fault.I want your license.- I want your goddamn license!- Okay.You have ruined my life!- I need you to trust me!- Trust you?!How the hell am I supposed to trust you?You spent years under the same roof, and you're just now realizing - your brother's a psychopath?- I know.You have taken everything from me!- You are the reason I lost my son!- Ally.Al...- All right, I know.- You understand that?- I know.I know.- Goddamn you!I'm sorry.Ally...I am going to put you back together with your son, if it is the last thing I do.
