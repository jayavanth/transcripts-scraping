BEVERLY: A severed head. A brutal attack. People are being targeted.Chem trucks are invading our neighborhood in the dead of the night.Our own government is poisoning us.What has happened to our great nation?BEVERLY: Are our children safe? Is there a serial killer loose? Family members remain hopeful tonight that Meadow Wilton will be found alive.But with crime on the rise, authorities are warning the public to stay inside.Lock your doors.This is Beverly Hope, reporting to you from a neighborhood gripped in terror.Back to you, Bob.What the hell is this sh1t?Crime is the lowest it's been in years.The number of calls have gone down.There's all sorts of goddamn holes in your stories.And how is it that you're always the first one on the scene?I'm not revealing my sources.My sources are telling me that you're full of sh1t.I talked to the chief of police.He says it's way too early to use the words "serial killer." Make us look like we don't know what the f*ck we're doing.When do we work for the cops?The public deserves to know the truth.You're scaring the sh1t out of people.Stop editorializing.Stop reporting fake news.And stop giving airtime to that nutjob who's running for city council.Nobody gives a sh1t about the zoning board.The world isn't all about butterflies and puppy adoptions.People would know that if you aired the tape of what happened to Serena.That's not news.That's sensationalism.You sure there isn't another reason you're sitting on the tape, Bob?Well, her parents are suing us because we didn't protect her, but... they don't need a visual.Not to mention you were f*cking their dumb-as-shit baby girl.You shut your goddamn mouth, Beverly.In fact, screw it.You're fired.You sure you want to do that, Bob?You sure you want to force me to call a press conference and talk about the many times I saw you sexually harassing the dead girl?Get the f*ck out of my office.Have a nice day, Bob.There's no official polling for the city council race, so Kai asked me to do my own unscientific poll around town.Needless to say, voter awareness is pretty low.Most people don't know about the special election or who is running or what the city council even does.Why are we even trying to win some stupid election?Who cares if Kai's on city council?Because the perception of credibility leads to the perception of power.Because people don't follow experts anymore, they follow titles.And when we get our sh1t together, and cause enough panic and fear, the sheep are gonna turn to their leaders to save them.And because city council is the only goddamn election available...that leader is gonna have to be a goddamn city councilman.HARRISON: People aren't scared enough.You'd think a serial killer leaving smiley faces everywhere would make people crap their drawers, but it's pretty much business as usual.We need to make the murders scarier.Throw in some satanic stuff like that movie Paradise Lost I saw on HBO once.BEVERLY: It doesn't matter if the devil himself rises up from hell and starts killing people around here as long as no one sees him do it.The world isn't "tell me," it's "show me." People aren't scared because they haven't seen the goddamn clowns.We are pulling off the cinematic Clockwork Orange sh1t, and it's like we're putting on a show for ourselves.You're the one who couldn't get your boss to air the Serena tape.That was a work of art, man.He'll never air it.And he's beginning to catch on that my impartiality as a reporter... might be compromised.Well...then I guess we're just gonna have to kill Bob.In the most horrible, - satanic way possible.- (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)And you're gonna film it.You're late.Sorry.What'd I miss?♪ ♪(EXHALES)♪ ♪ (MOANS)ALLY: I woke up and saw that I scratched myself raw. VINCENT: Black bugs.- That's never happened before.- No.I've always been afraid of...the holes.But this time...the holes were on my skin, and...This isn't a surprise to me.Your trypophobia isn't simply a biological revulsion.It's deeply rooted in your subconscious.You're afraid of falling into the darkness of your life.Metaphorically, the holes were created by everything that's happened.Ally, you've been through a lot.Oh...God.When Ivy took Oz...I thought it would be hard.But it's been unbearable.I realized I have a biological need to see my son.Every day.(SNIFFLES)And when I couldn't, it was...it was another hole I couldn't fill.And I'm heartbroken.And angry.And not just at her, but at me.For letting this happen.For...being tempted.I'm so glad to hear you say that.You're taking some responsibility.That is the first step to conquering any fear, because it's up to you to pull yourself out.Yeah, well, she's clearly not gonna help me.She's made it so I have to stay in that house alone.By myself.A house that was marked by a serial killer.They told me that I would have police protection.I have seen one police car drive by in three days.Is there any way that you can stay in a hotel?Ivy canceled all the credit cards.Everything I have is tied up in the restaurant.I own the building, which means I'm strapped for cash until I sell.I mean, I have enough to live.Barely.It was like she prepared.She closed down everything...so fast.Did you have any idea that your relationship with Ivy might be tenuous?Hi.(SIGHS)- I'm tired.- I know.I know you've been working hard.Yeah, we...- we had three cancellations tonight.- Mmm.On a slow night, that's the profit margin.Do you know that?Three tables.We are digging ourselves into a hole, financially.I have a surprise for you.(CHUCKLES)- (CHUCKLES)- Whatever it is, - we can't afford it.- Open it.Come on.Jesus, Ally.(SCOFFS)What were you thinking?Uh, I was thinking that we might have fun.Like a happy, loving couple.I was thinking that you might give a sh1t.ALLY: I thought it was because of the election. But now I don't know. Every little piece of my life has fallen apart.Can I make a suggestion?You can only work on things that you are personally in control of.Ivy's out of the question.What can we do that will help you today?ALLY: Ivy convinced a judge to allow only supervised visits with Oz. And I was so nervous. I didn't even know how to act naturally. You know what, I almost forgot.I brought you something from home.So you aren't stuck scribbling your masterpieces on hotel napkins.Thanks.Do you have any favorite things you like drawing these days?I don't know.Ooh, I know.You used to be obsessed with pirates.Maybe you can draw me one.(EXHALES)I remember when you were little, and...you'd make me put on that eyepatch.Do you remember?And I'd chase you around the house, and...you'd wave your plastic sword at me and I'd be like, "Aye, aye, Captain Ozymandius, "who shall walk the plank today?Argh." Mama, you're being weird.I'm sorry.(CHUCKLES)ALLY (CRYING): I need you to help me not lose my son.- Did you eat?- OZ (OVER PHONE): Yeah, we had pizza.Is it okay if I watch Guardians of the Galaxy with Jeremy?There's some cussing.What does Jeremy's mom say?She says, "Fine." Okay.Don't stay up too late.And you listen to what Jeremy's mom says.And I will see you tomorrow.I love you.Love you, too, Mom.Bye.WINTER: So, he seems okay.(CHUCKLES)He gets to sleep over at Jeremy's house on a school night.And he loves being at the motel.Vending machines.No, Oz is great.Has he asked about Ally?In a way.He wanted to know if you were gonna be his third mom.I'm sorry he had to be the one to find the video, Ivy, but it had to be that way.I get how this works, what needs to be done, and I've been doing it, haven't I?It's just...things are about to get really real.This isn't knitting a pink pussy hat and marching with a clever sign.This is radical action.Radicals are the only people who've ever gotten anything done.I'm ready.I hate this country.What it's become.I hate my f*cking wife for letting it happen.The only thing I love right now is my son, and I will do whatever it takes to make the world a better place for him, even if it means burning it all down.Good.Then you'll do great.We're here.Make a right there.KAI: It's time. Here, use this phone.It's top-rated for low light photography.And, remember, on the kill shot, everybody chant "Ave Satanas." Wouldn't it be better if we said "Hail Satan" in English?So that people understand.Not that I ever feel the need to explain myself, but it's about spreading terror.Latin is inherently scary.Fine.(CLICK)(PHONE BEEPS)(BOWL CLINKS)(BOB GRUNTS)(GROANING)(GASPING)(PANTS)What?(SCREAMS)(PANTING)(GASPING)(PANTING)(GASPS)What do you want?I-I have money.KAI: That's not gonna help you now.f*ck you.(SHOUTING)(GROANS)(GRUNTS)(GROANING)You gonna kill me?ALL: Ave Satanas.
