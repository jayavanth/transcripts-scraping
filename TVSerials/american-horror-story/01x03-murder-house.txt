(humming)Mm.Don't stop.I'll be finished in here in just a second.Why?A shame to waste such a beautiful bed.Don't. No, don't.No, stop, please. No!Stop it!You're drunk.Please, I really need this job.You liked it the last time.That was a mistake.I was just lonely.Want a Camaro?Huh?We got a new shipment in yesterday.No, I...(screaming)(muffled sobbing)Shh.(muffled sobbing in distance)(sobbing)(shrieks)I have loved you since I was 16.Sweetheart, please.This-This didn't mean anything.You've broken my heart for the last time.(whimpers)(panting)(sobbing)We were just getting it back, Ben.I wanted to trust you so badly.I was trying to protect you.Oh, don't try to turn this into some kind of heroic act!You were scared shitless of what I might do if I found out about it.How was I supposed to know he was gonna screw up our investments that badly?He's always made us money before.Well, I am pregnant, and I cannot live in this house after what happened to us here!And now you're telling me that we have no choice, that we're broke?We're not broke.We have money.It's just tied up in this house.Once we sell it, we can take it out.No, no.I-I can't wait that long.I-- we...we have to, we have to rent a place.Viv, what do you want me to do?I'm trying to rebuild my practice.We're already paying the minimum on our cards.I'll get a job.To put more stress on yourself?(sighs)Fine.We'll get a studio apartment somewhere.We can, we can swing that, at least, at least temporarily.Studio apartment?You think that's gonna take the pressure off?My office is here.People see me here.Patients see me here.And not that many, I might add.(sighs)Honey, you're having PTSD.This is a total normal response.We just need to find you a therapist that our insurance will cover.Right away.Don't make me feel like I'm crazy.I have an appointment with the realtor tomorrow.I'm gonna talk to her about what kind of home improvements we can make - hopefully nothing too expensive, maybe something with the backyard.Hopefully we can sell the place without taking too much of a loss.Sure.I'm sure we can.Don't lie to me again.If you lie to me again, we're through.I am just horrified for you and your family.I hardly know what to say, really.And I can just imagine how you might be feeling a little anxious, given all of this.Nope, not anxious. Angry.You know that's how I felt when the boys, you know, did what they did.We'd gotten rather close.They'd have me over for Bloody Marys and omelettes on a Sunday.So to find out what nasty little perverts they were - you probably heard about the poker from the fireplace being rammed up his...Marcy, we have to put the house back on the market.And we have to make back everything we put into it.We just can't afford to take a bath on this.You know, you might want to adjust your expectations.The housing market is dropping daily.And these things aren't about to change until 2013, when we vote that bum out.Well, here's the bottom line:you owe our family.Under the law, you were obligated to disclose any material facts that might have influenced our decision to buy this house.Excuse me, dear, but the law requires us to disclose any death on the premises within the last three years.I did that.Nobody's buying me cooking classes, Mrs. Hormon.Harmon.Nobody's looking out for me.Do you know where I live?I live in a 350-square-foot guest house in Valley Village, with rats.I'd kill to live in this house, regardless of the history.You know, you probably need a more seasoned realtor.Someone who specializes in...Oh, you think you were my first call?I called every realtor in the city this morning--Coldwellke Banker, Century 21.No one will take this listing.So here's the plan.You are going to bake cookies, you are going to go buy beautiful, expensive, fresh-cut flowers, you are going to maybe make up some nice stories about all the lovely people who have lived here over the years.You're gonna do whatever it takes and you are gonna sell this house, and then my family and I are gonna go live someplace safe.And in return for that, I am not gonna sue you for gross criminal negligence.We on the same page?Good.See? Somebody's looking out for you.It's fresh.I just made it.(knocking, gasps)I thought I'd knock this time so you didn't have a heart attack.Though Lord knows I wish you were dead.Do me a favor, will you?Before I take this one, polish it up.Look, it's cruddy with corrosion.And you know why?Because you're a shitty maid.Adding those to your magpie stash?Until I have a full set.Then it's off to eBay, where I'll make a pretty penny and you'll be accused of theft.You are a thief of biblical proportions, after all.Your specialty being weak husbands.I don't want to be here anymore!I'm frightened!I miss my mother!You think I want to stay in this world of death and rot and regret?Try to find some dignity in the situation.Move on, missy.I can't.I want to, but I can't!Every time...I find my heart breaking just a sliver for you, I suddenly remember, you made this mess for yourself.And I also remember, every time I see that ghostly eye, that I was and continue to be(chuckles) a hell of a shot.You need to pay for what you've done.Oh, I do.Every goddamn day.SALLY:I'm at the end of my rope.(recorder beeps)He's going through with it, and there's nothingI can do to stop him.We're supposed to sign the papers next week, and that's it.23 years gone with the stroke of a pen.I'm so upset.And I wonder if I'll ever be able to love or be loved again.What was the reason your husband is seeking the divorce?He says I'm very boring.I've tried to converse with him on a variety of subjects.Sports for instance.I even learned the names of the football teams he follows.Let's see, here's the Chargers, the 49ers, the Raiders, the Seahawks up in Seattle.That's the West Coast.Then the Cardinals.They're in Arizona.I memorized them... for him.I'm very good at memorization.I can still name the states and all of their capitals, which I learned in the sixth grade.My memory helps with my work.I'm an accountant by trade, but I'm branching out into taxes.(crow caws, dog barks)What are you doing?Cleaning up your mess.My mess?Well, it's not my blood.How long have you been out here?Long enough.What did you see?Why, nothing.Nothing at all, if anyone should ask.I'm very discrete.Don't worry.I did this room first.It's all ready for your next victim.I mean patient.Where's my tape recorder?It was right here.I don't know what you're talking about.I never touch the things on your desk.I just get the stains.Do you wanna make a new one?Get away from me.Where is it?Think about the blood.Rushing.Pumping.Filling you up.Filling us both up.I'm done playing this game!You're goddamn fired!What the hell are you doing?I did not want to get physical with her, but I had no choice.I have rebuffed every advance, and believe me, there have been many, but she just won't stop!Unbuttoning, and bending over and...I don't mean to be presumptuous, but my days of romance are long over.Oh, please. Is that why you prance around in that little maid's outfit like you're headed to a fetish ball?Don't want to clean other people's houses in your own clothes, my ass.Ben!It's all right, Madame.I'm not naive to the ways of men.Their need to objectify, conquer.They see what they want to see.Women, however, see into the soul of a person.Is this what you do?Entrap employers?That said, I understand the stress you two are under.Money, the baby, what happened here the other night.I don't mean to listen, but the walls here are paper thin.This unfortunate incident aside, I am happy to work for the two of you.And I certainly need the money, times are tough.I'm perfectly willing to forget the whole thing.Well, Moira, I think maybe it might just be better for you to...Just leave?Just toss me out like a piece of trash, will you?No, you won't. Not this time.I deserve respect.If your husband lays a hand on me again, or tries to fire me with unjust cause, I will press charges.I changed the sheets in your bedroom, fresh towels in the downstairs bath and Violet's.If you don't mind I'd like to take a longer lunch than usual.I'm quite shaken.She's lying.I knew we shouldn't have hired her in the first place, I knew it.You know what I think?What?I think your little...indiscretion in Boston...has really screwed you up.And I think you're acting out and you're being paranoid and crazy and guilty, and you have to get it together.And we have to get out of this house.I'd like to do that without a lawsuit.STAN: And the next stop on our tour of departed souls - the gem of mid-town, Murder House.(nearby clatter)Relax.I'm not here to bust you.Why not?Because what you guys went through last week can haunt you a long time.Seriously, Dad? I'm fine.It'll make a great college essay one day.Okay. But if you ever want to talk to somebody...Dad...I mean, not me.You know, I'm way too expensive.But we can find you someone.Okay, thanks.I'll think about it.He's a great dad.He really cares.You're lucky like that.Where's my tape recorder?Hmm?I need it for my work.Here's your coffee, Dr. Harmon.I don't want any damn coffee.I want my tape recorder.It was in my office until you cleaned up. I need it.Well, it might be down the front of my dress.All you have to do is reach down between my breasts...You're sick.I hope it's not a problem.Your next patient is in your office.My next patient?I'm sorry, I-I didn't have anyone on my schedule...What are you doing here?This is my house!I'm not stupid, Ben.I saw her leave.I just want to talk.Not in my house.Jesus, Hayden, I've called you a dozen times since I left Boston.You left me there, Ben.Without a word.By myself.I know, I know.I'm sorry, but I told you in my messages.We had a home invasion here.I had to come back.Did everything go all right?I didn't have the abortion.What?I decided to keep the baby.Our baby.I'm moving here, and you're paying.You're going to be a father to our child.I've already started looking for a place.I think I really like Marina Del Rey.Hayden, you-you-you really haven't thought this through.I love my wife, my family.As far as support, you have to believe me, the move out here took everything I had.I-I don't have the financial resources...I'm not a whore, Ben.I matter.I didn't say...I matter!(doorbell rings)I'm looking for a Dr. Ben Harmon.That's me.Detective Jack Colquitt.L.A.P.D.I need a moment of your time.The detective wants to talk to me.Fine, meet me tomorrow at 3:00.There's a Norms down the street.BEN: I told the other officer everything.My wife and daughter were the ones those animals terrorized.Sorry. That's robbery/homicide.I'm missing persons.I'm here about Sally Freeman.She's a patient of yours.Our first session was Tuesday.I'm sorry...missing persons?Her husband hasn't seen her.She didn't come home last night.He didn't seem too concerned.They're getting a divorce.Her online calendar listed you as a 3:00 appointment.Did she show up?Yes.Then you were the last one who saw her.She also had a Power Point class down at the Learning Annex, but she bailed on that.Well, I can't tell you what we talked about, but I can say it was nothing extreme.Well, I'm not surprised.Just between you and I, everyone I talked to about that gal said she was the most boring person they'd ever met.How the hell do you get anything done with that thing around?Right?Anyway, like I said, it's probably nothing.But if you hear anything, give me a call?Sure.No problem.I'll let myself out.Hopefully run into your maid.Change your mind?No.No...I told you I ain't no faggot.That's not what your dick says.Easy, man.You were cruisin' me, I thought you were fair game.Cruisin' you, my ass.Easy!Help! Help!God!STAN: Sal Mineo was 37 years old when he died.A Golden Globe winner and two-time Oscar nominee.His father was a coffin-maker who never accepted that his son was gay.They sent away a petty criminal,African-American Lionel RaymondWilliams for the murder, calling it a "robbery gone wrong."But you'll have a hard time finding anyone who believes that in this town.Most people believe Sal Mineo died of a hate crime.Our tour concludes with one of the most famous houses of horrors in the City of Angels... better known as the "Murder House."
