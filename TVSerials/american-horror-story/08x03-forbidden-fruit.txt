There's really no need to thank me.TIMOTHY: Ms. Mead said you're the only reasonEmily and I haven't been executed.You saved our lives.I've been charged with finding the seedsfrom which the future of mankind will blossom.It'd be grossly irresponsibleto allow a minor infraction to keep out a viable candidate.The stakes are too high.- But I killed my nana.
- Hmm.Nonsense.She died peacefully... in her sleep.Trust me.You have nothing to worry about.You see, I have a talent.Call it a kind of night vision of the soul.I can see into the dark placesthat people desperately try to keep hidden.I don't have any dark places.Really?So even though you've worked for Coco for many years, and...even though she saved your life after the bombs fell,why do I believe that you'd love nothing morethan to pick up anything sharp enough to cut clayand slice her throat down to the bone?I'd say that qualifies, Mallory.Wouldn't you?She can be a handful sometimes,and... yeah,she sometimes makes me do things I'd rather not.You're f*cking kidding me, right?I just painted my nails.Come on, wipe me![MALLORY SIGHS]That doesn't mean I want to kill her.She's spoiled, and she's entitled, but...she's also helpless.She needs me.You wouldn't believe how many times I tried to fire her.I mean, Mallory could f*ck up a one-car funeral,but it was always just easier to keep her around.- The devil you know.
- [CHUCKLES]- It's interesting.
- What?After my speech about seeing into the dark places,I've come to realize something about you.- Something dark?
- No.True darkness requires a certain depth of character,but you're much too shallowfor any kind of meaningful negativity.I'm not quite sure how to take that.I'm just saying it's wonderful to see you again.I was surprised to find you here when I arrived.- Pleasantly?
- That depends.Should I be concerned about you causing me any trouble?You know I'm not powerful enoughto stop whatever it is you're up to.No... but I don't like unpredictability,unless I'm responsible for it.Neither do I,which means I don't like not knowing what's to come,at least when my life is concerned.I want to get to that Sanctuary.You will.You're exactly the kind of soul I'm looking forto build my new world.And what kind of soul is that?ANDRE: Evil.Sounds corny, I know,but there's no better word to describe my mother.It is all about her.Nothing in this world even exists unless it relates to her.I'm sure she thinks this entire war was just, like,some conspiracy to cancel her show.She doesn't deserve to be here.You've made the assumptionthat I'm looking for people who are pure of heart,unblemished, pure lily white.The old world lived under a set of rules.Thou shalt not kill.Thou shall love thy neighbor, etcetera, etcetera.Rules that were clearly honored in the breach.I want a world without the hypocrisy,with the kinds of peoplewho wouldn't just eat from the fruit of the forbidden tree,but who'd cut the f*cking tree downand burn it for firewood.I think you're made for that world, Mallory.I sense it in you.I want to leave.You're afraid.Aren't you?Of accepting who you are?I don't know who I am.What do you mean?Sometimes...I feel like there's someone buried inside me.Someone trying to claw their way out.Who?I don't know. I just want to go.- Let me go.

- If they're prewar,how would they have been preserved?It's really not that hard to imagine.Modern apples have a shelf life of monthsbecause of all the chemicals they inject into themat special atmospheric packing facilities.I ran a nutrition blog before the war.It was really catching on, I think.Maybe they were grown in The Sanctuary.Langdon must have had them delivered to show everyonewhat will be waiting for the chosen.Not sure that's a...Exquisite.I'd swear it was tree-ripened.Looks like a Red Delicious.Probably grown on the East Coast.They're not from the East Coast.They're a gift from the gods.They're divine providence.The answer to our prayer.Perhaps you should take care of the horsesbefore they die on the lawn.[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]There's not a bad apple in the bunch.What if they were all bad?What do you mean?Poisoned.Might take a little work to extract it,but we've got plenty.And we won't have to convince any of them to devour these.But we need to make surethey all eat them at the same time.A party, perhaps.[GURGLING][ELEVATOR BEEPS]MALLORY: I don't know who I am.LANGDON: I can see into the dark placesthat people desperately try to keep hidden.MALLORY: I don't have any dark places.LANGDON: Really?You're afraid.Of accepting who you are.MALLORY: Sometimes I feellike there's someone buried inside me.Someone trying to claw their way out.LANGDON: Who?[ECHOING SCREAMING]WOMAN: Mallory.Come on, Venable called an emergency meeting.These past several months have been difficult for all of us.And perhaps, in my efforts to keep us safe,punitive measures have been taken too far.I believe now what we need is a moment of celebration,camaraderie.Which is why this weekend, as a gesture of goodwill,we will have a Halloween soiree...- Ah.
- Ah....in the style of a Victorian masquerade ball.It's Halloween this weekend?[CLEARS THROAT] If only my nana were hereto enjoy it with me.VENABLE: We've all lost track of time a bit.And this festive occasionis the perfect opportunity to remedy this.And I encourage you all to use your imaginations,to create what I am sure will be exquisite costumes.Attendance is mandatory.Mallory...why are you molesting my Loubs?I was just thinking maybe I could use the spikes for a mask.You've always hated this pair, you haven't touched them- for years.
- Well, have you ever heardof something having sentimental value?Besides, I don't think the, uh,fancy dressing up stuff is really for you Grays.- [MR. GALLANT LAUGHS]
- Oh, my God,do you remember that Halloween where you dressed upas young Michael Jackson from The Jackson ,and then I dressed as Michael Jackson on trialfor touching little boys?- Yes! It was the best.
- [MR. GALLANT SQUEALING]I f*cking love Halloween.
It's the one day of the yearwhen the rest of the world puts in some effortto be fabulous, like I am every other day.I don't know why Venable has such a hard-on for Halloween.It's not like we've celebrated any other holidayssince we checked into this hellhole.The closest thing we had to a Christmas feast was Stu.- Yeah.
- Wait.What if Halloween is an excuse? [GASPS]Oh, my God.They're using the partyto announce who's going to The Sanctuary.Okay, we have to rethink this whole look.- I just, I think it's too much.
- What?I don't want to rub it in for the ones that don't get picked.No offense, Mallory.I didn't think I was going anyways.I think that the people who are gonna go already know.Wait. What do you mean? Did Langdon tell you you're in?[SIGHS] Well, let's just sayour one-on-one was very illuminating.Wait.Did something weird happen to you, too?What are you babbling about? What did he say to you?It wasn't anything he said.It was... uh... a feeling.[SCREAMING]I think I set the room on fire.What? Like you knocked over a candle or something?No. Like flames shot out of the fireplace and went everywhere.I know this is impossible,but I think I made the fire with my mind.[SCOFFS]Yeah, we're definitely not talking about the same thing.Maybe it was the blast, the radiation,it did something and now I'm like the Dark Phoenix.What are you saying? Are you saying you have superpowers now?I don't know.Never mind.Oh, well, hey, Mallory,uh, there's a fire right there, bitch, do it again.Come on. Prove it.Make flames shoot out everywhere.[CLICKS TONGUE] Oh. This is pretty lame,even for you, Mallory.Some people just have nothing special about them,and you have to be okay with that.Maybe you can see if you have a superpowerthat allows you to shut your piehole and get back to work.My costume isn't going to make itself.And why are you even touching my stuff?Evie's room is full of crap that you can use,not that she'll be needing any of it anymore.Maybe I can see if I've got a superpowerto make you disappear.- She's out of her mind.
- [DOOR CLOSES][INDISTINCT CHATTER]- Ow.
- No treats until the time comes.Nobody's even seen a piece of fresh fruitin over months. Where did this come from?Perhaps I should drag in one of the horseswho rode through hell to gift us these sweet little wondersso you can look it in the mouth.MR. GALLANT: I know. It's symbolic.It's the Garden of Eden, apples from paradise.It's obviously from The Sanctuary.We should say grace to thank the universe for sending them to us.- You are so f*cking annoying.
