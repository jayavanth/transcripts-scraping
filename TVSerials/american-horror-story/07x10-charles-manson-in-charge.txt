Trump: If Russia and the United States got along well - and went after ISIS...- (laughing)I wonder if this is how black people felt when Obama became president.I know it's super not Vassar or PC to say this, but I think Hillary is even more important than Obama.The fight for civil rights lasted a couple of hundred years.The fight for female equality lasted, like...thousands.WINTER: I guess you're right.Black men did get the right to vote before women did.- DOROTHY: Yeah, right?- HILLARY: Well, that's because - he'd rather have a puppet as president...- (laughter)RILEY: Oh, my God.- You're the puppet.- Oh, my God.(laughing)There's no way people are buying this sh1t.I'm telling you, she's gonna flip Texas and maybe even Arizona.It's gonna be the biggest loss in electoral college

shielded you from what's really going on out there.WINTER: Right.Economic anxiety, aka racism.People hate her.She's weak.Remember what happened a few weeks ago at the / memorial ceremony?She had to be carried to a car.Everyone knows it's early onset Parkinson's.They hate the sound of her voice, they hate the fact that she can't satisfy her husband.The world isn't this progressive, happy place you think it is, okay?People tolerated the black guy, but nobody wants a woman president.Not even other women.Who told you that?Your chan Pepe frog-fucking buddies?In between exchanging pictures of dead people and sh1t p0rn?You win if people turn out to vote.And nobody is turning out for that shrill, cuck bitch.Have you seen Trump's rallies?The passion?The passion of the angry white man.- Boo-fucking-hoo for you.- That's right!We've been humiliated and put down for too long.Trump is one of us!We will stand out bleeding in the rain and snow to vote for him.It is all about shame and humiliation for you assholes.You know, we should start some sort of, like, government program to get you all laid so you'll shut up.Yeah, you probably wouldn't even need to get f*cked.Just some pretty girl smiling at you, telling you how important you are.You ever notice how all the alt-righters are young men?- And none of them have girlfriends?- (laughing)Hey, Winter, uh, give me some lotion.I'm gonna give your brother a handy, so...Kai!What the f*ck, Kai?- Are you okay?- I'm sorry.- (sobbing)- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.Are you okay?- Are you all right?- (gasps)I am pressing

today, after a political rally erupted into violence, leaving people injured.Local councilman Kai Anderson, who was recently catapulted onto the national stage after an assassination attempt and some unorthodox and controversial city ordinances that he passed, he clashed today with counter-protesters after lashing out against Senator Herbert Jackson, who he plans to unseat during the midterm elections.Here's what Senator Jackson had to say earlier today.The only blue hairs I respond to are the sweet little old ladies of my state, not some alt-right extremist.REPORTER: So you're not taking Councilman Anderson's challenge seriously?Please.If anyone should be taking Mr.Anderson seriously, it should be the Department of Justice.You seeing this sh1t?!Screw that guy right in the ass!- Yeah!-
