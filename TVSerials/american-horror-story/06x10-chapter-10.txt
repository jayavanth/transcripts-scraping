Why?Courts won't do sh1t.Polk family ain't never got justice in all our history.(sniffs)She took my babies.Killed my kin.Well, if the law won't deal with her...I sure will.(laughing)Narrator: Lee Harris. Decorated police officer, loving wife, devoted mother.She was a woman who had it all, until she cracked.(glass shatters)♪ ♪Narrator: Lee Miller was a shy girl, gifted.She had big dreams, and in the fall of 2005, it felt like all of her dreams were coming true.Lee fell madly in love with a charismatic engineer named Mason Harris.And soon after came Lee's greatest joy, Flora.But little did Lee know that her happy life was about to spiral out of control.A custody battle... a kidnapping, a murder.A hit TV show.Millions of Americans met Lee Harris in 2015...Can we stop for a moment, please?...when a sleeper hit, My Roanoke Nightmare, first premiered.She was a woman of many secrets.Dangerous. Deadly.Put down the gun!The police long suspected that Lee was responsible for the death of her husband, Mason, but the evidence was purely circumstantial.Well, we have no smoking gun, but I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, Lee Harris killed her ex-husband in cold blood.(reporters clamoring)Phillips: So I had to wait and watch while this murderer became a celebrity...We have the pleasure to sit down with Lee Harris...Phillips: ...profiting from her crimes.It's shameful.Narrator: The prosecution didn't have to wait long.The following year, the next installment of the series aired, setting an all-time ratings record.Lee committed not one but multiple homicides.On camera.(screaming)(grunting)We had her.Monet Tumusiime's sister sat in the front row every day of that trial to remind me that my job was to speak up for the victims.Narrator: But the defense had a plan up their sleeve to render the mountain of evidence irrelevant.The strain of marijuana recovered from the Polk residence was highly unusual.It tested positive for hallucinogenic properties.It was obvious that that magic pot was messing with her brain.She was seeing things.Narrator: They played on the jury's emotions, forced them to watch the recording from the Polk farm in its entirety.The guy pickled her ear, at chunks out of her body, carved her up like a Christmas ham.(Lee screaming)No wonder she thought everybody was after her.I would have lost my damn mind.Hallucinations, trauma, extreme duress-- this is the textbook definition of diminished capacity.She didn't know what she was doing.She knew exactly what she was doing.(camera shutters clicking)Narrator: In a stunning turn of events, Lee Harris was acquitted of all charges.Phillips: It was an abomination.There was no way I was gonna stand by and watch this woman elude justice-- not again.So I played the only card I had left.Went after her for her original crime-- the murder of Mason.I killed Daddy.That's on me, and me alone.No one else helped me.It's nobody's fault except mine.Phillips: I had her on tape, confessing.We had Matt's security footage clearly revealing Lee leaving that house at 10:13 p.m.And phone records revealed a call between Lee and Mason at 10:19 p.m. that lasted six minutes.And it was our contention that Lee Harris was arranging a rendezvous with her ex-husband.And the reason we thought that...The prosecution calls Flora Harris.(excited murmurs)We had an eyewitness.You were in the woods a long time.That must have been scary.Now, when you were out there, did you see anything strange?Yes.Who'd you see?Mom and Dad.And what were they doing?They were fighting.Flora: It was about me, as usual.My dad, he said my mom kidnapped me at school, and she was hiding me.So he wanted to tell the cops.So your father threatened to involve the police.What'd your mom do next?He walked away... and she picked up a rock.And what did she do with the rock, Flora?She hit him.(gallery murmuring)Flora: He fell, and she hit him again, until he stopped moving.You killed Daddy.(gasps, murmurs)(gavel bangs)Flora, did your mom or your dad ever see you that night?No. I was hiding.No further questions.(whispering indistinctly)Stephanie: Your father thought your mother was hiding you.But that wasn't true, was it?You chose to go out into the woods, didn't you?Yes.Why didn't you go to your mother and father?Because...I didn't want them to find me.Why not?Because...I felt safe.You felt safe?Alone? In the woods?I wasn't alone.I was with Priscilla.Priscilla. The ghost girl from the TV show.Yeah.(excited murmuring)(gavel bangs)Stephanie: You felt safer in the woods with a dead girl's spirit than you did with your own parents?I was much happier with Priscilla than I ever was with you.(shocked murmuring)(buzzer sounds)♪ ♪Stephanie: The words of an imaginative girl, from a broken home.Her mother an addict, her father an angry man with an explosive temper.Is it any surprise that this poor child...Gotcha!...invented a friend with whom she felt safe?Where'd she go?Stephanie: Lee's taped confession.I killed Daddy.An obvious attempt by Ms. Harris to stop the abuse of her kidnapper.For all we know, Flora, this impressionable child, may have seen that tape and built false memories around it.Her testimony may condemn Ms. Harris as a mother, but it does not prove that she is a murderer.Narrator: It was 16 days before the jury reached a verdict.♪ ♪Woman: We were split, on Flora's testimony.Judge: I understand the jury has reached a verdict.What say you?Juror number five: I know the Roanoke show was a popular show.We find the defendant...But I couldn't send a woman to jail based on ghost stories....not guilty.(excited clamoring)(gavel banging)(indistinct chatter)Phillips: Well, I'll tell you one thing.Lee Harris must be one damn good actress.Maybe even better than the woman who played her.You know, in my entire legal career, to this day, that verdict was the hardest to swallow.(camera shutters clicking, reporters clamoring)Flora...Flora. Just talk to me, please.Flora?Phillips: You know, it's easy to break this kind of thing down to winners and losers.But nobody won here.I mean, sure, Lee Harris dodged a sentence.I think she lost a lot more.(glass shatters)Lee Harris. Equally reviled and celebrated.She is one of the most provocative and polarizing figures of our time.Lee endured and survived a harrowing experience that would've destroyed most people.She rose from the depths of her torture and wrote a bestselling book, became a highly-paid speaker, but some would say Lee never escaped.That in fighting monsters, she became one herself.I killed Daddy.That's on me, and me alone.No one else helped me.It's nobody's fault except mine.The murder trials of Lee Harris captured the hearts and minds of an entire nation.And when it was time to announce the verdict, it seemed as though the whole world stood still.It was the second time Lee successfully navigated a journey of horrors.Acquitted of all charges, exonerated by a jury of her peers, and yet questions remain.It is for this fascinating woman, that I have come out of retirement.Lee Harris has agreed to do an interview to tell the world her side of an extraordinary story, unedited, unfiltered, live on television.Welcome to The Lana Winters Special.♪ ♪Lee.Thank you for agreeing to this interview.There are so many questions I want to ask, so much everyone is dying to know.I will start with the most important question first.How are you?You had me there.Well, I honestly want to know.You have been through hell and back, and so many people would've simply given up.This I know.To what do you attribute your resilience?Well, it's good to have a goal in mind, Mm-hmm. something to hope for. Mm-hmm.For me, that's Flora.Your daughter.It's always been about her.At my darkest times, she kept me alive.The thought of Flora being alone in the world, the joy of seeing her again, and... to watch her grow up.It's kept me going.How is your relationship with your daughter today?At the moment, spare.I can only imagine how painful that must be for you now.Having to go back into a courtroom yet again, this time to fight for custody.Mason's family have decided that I'm not a good influence on my own daughter.Even though I've been acquitted of all charges.You have to admit, those horrible images remain.The public will always associate Lee Harris with the deaths of three innocent people.Not to mention your husband.Flora's father.And by acquitting you, the jury, and basically half of America, are calling Flora-- your daughter-- a liar.I did not come here to be put on trial again.But why are you here, Lee?Why did you agree to this interview?What do you mean?Well, I know for a fact that you turned everybody else down.Diane Sawyer.Barbara Walters.Because of you.Because of... who you are.And what you've been through.I mean, Jesus.You killed your own son.Bloody Face.I killed a psychopathic murderer before he could kill me.I did what I had to do.Exactly. You know there are extenuating circumstances in every action you take.Of course.That's why I agreed to talk to you.Well, It's not really me you came here to talk to, is it?Your daughter has refused to speak to you since your acquittal, isn't that right?I'm praying she's watching, and that she'll somehow see this so I can tell her what she needs to know.Well... this is your chance.Tell her.Flora, I'm gonna tell you something that maybe you already know.But you need to hear it from my heart.I love you, baby.And I'm never gonna give up.Never stop, until we are together again.You feel better?Yeah.Where is she, Lee?What?Flora.Where is she? Is that some sort of trick question?Flora Harris was reported missing by her grandparents an hour before we went on the air.Where is she? Lee?What are you talking about?I know that our viewers will understand the desperation of a mother separated from her daughter, but if you have abducted her again, Lee, now is the time to come clean before things spiral out of control.(whispers): My God, Jesus.Lee.Please sit down.I have to find my daughter.(automatic gunfire in distance)(people screaming in distance)Man: What the hell was that?Lana: That's a goddamn assault weapon.(automatic gunfire continues)Lana: Lee, sit down.Sit down, goddamn it!(shouts, gunshots)Oh, God.(grunting)Lee: Oh, my God. It's Lot.
